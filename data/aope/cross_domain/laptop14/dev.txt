THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .####[([6, 7], [10, 11])]
Plain and simple , it ( laptop ) runs great and loads fast .####[([8], [9]), ([11], [12])]

There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .####[([4], [2])]
( I had been a Windows/Linux user before this ) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for ( Internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .####[([13], [11]), ([16], [36])]

The performance is awesome .####[([1], [3])]
In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they `` expedited '' the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a `` Senior Tech '' .####[([65, 66], [57, 58, 59, 60])]

Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .####[([0], [2]), ([5, 6], [7]), ([9], [7])]
But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .####[([6], [7])]
No temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because `` many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset `` -Inquired status of repair .####[([17, 18], [14])]
Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .####[([3], [13, 14])]

The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !####[([1], [22])]
The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .####[([9, 10], [14])]
It 's super fast and a great value for the price !####[([7], [6]), ([10], [6])]
