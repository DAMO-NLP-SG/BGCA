Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .####[([0, 1], [4])]
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .####[([0, 1], [3, 4])]
Set up was easy .####[([0, 1], [3])]
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .####[([5, 6], [1, 2]), ([8, 9], [1, 2])]
Other than not being a fan of click pads ( industry standard these days ) and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .####[([18, 19], [17])]
No installation disk ( DVD ) is included .####[([1, 2], [7])]
It 's fast , light , and simple to use .####[([9], [7])]
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .####[([0], [1]), ([13, 14], [7])]
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .####[([9], [3, 4, 5, 6])]
I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life ( > 6 hrs ) .####[([6, 7], [5]), ([10, 11], [9]), ([15, 16], [14])]
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .####[([8, 9], [4, 5, 6])]
Made interneting ( part of my business ) very difficult to maintain .####[([1], [9])]
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .####[([14], [16])]
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .####[([8, 9], [11, 12, 13])]
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics .####[([7], [6])]
But the mountain lion is just too slow .####[([2, 3], [7])]
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .####[([8], [0]), ([1], [0])]
The battery life is excellent -- 6-7 hours without charging .####[([1, 2], [4])]
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .####[([11], [12])]
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .####[([12, 13], [11])]
The baterry is very longer .####[([1], [4])]
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [8])]
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .####[([10], [7])]
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .####[([5], [3, 4]), ([8], [11])]
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great !####[([9], [11])]
It 's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .####[([6, 7], [9])]
This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for .####[([7], [6]), ([14, 15], [12])]
Keyboard responds well to presses .####[([0], [1, 2])]
Lastly , Windows 8 is annoying .####[([2, 3], [5])]
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .####[([7], [5]), ([9], [5])]
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .####[([3, 4], [1])]
Only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited .####[([2, 3], [9])]
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .####[([5], [4]), ([11], [10]), ([16], [15])]
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it .####[([1], [0])]
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .####[([8], [5]), ([10], [5])]
I was extremely happy with the OS itself .####[([6], [3])]
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .####[([5], [4])]
The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing .####[([18, 19], [17])]
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it .####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [8, 9])]
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .####[([2], [9])]
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .####[([4], [5]), ([10], [9])]
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind..I love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is Fast and clear as can be .####[([17, 18, 19], [29]), ([21, 22], [29])]
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows .####[([1, 2, 3], [5, 6]), ([15, 16], [13])]
However , I can refute that OSX is `` FAST '' .####[([6], [9])]
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !####[([2, 3], [0])]
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3])]
Built-in apps are purely amazing .####[([0, 1], [4])]
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily .####[([9, 10], [11])]
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .####[([4], [2])]
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ( $ 1500-2000 ) which also support `` accidents '' like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [16]), ([29], [26, 27])]
It 's light and easy to transport .####[([6], [4])]
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .####[([11, 12, 13], [17])]
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .####[([1, 2], [6, 7])]
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly .####[([5, 6, 7], [3]), ([10, 11], [15])]
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 '' RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered ( to me .####[([13, 14, 15], [17])]
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port ( will work with adapter ) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [1]), ([16, 17], [20])]
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .####[([1], [8])]
Well designed and fast .####[([1], [0])]
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .####[([14], [12])]
Exactly as posted plus a great value .####[([6], [5])]
The specs are pretty good too .####[([1], [4])]
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .####[([4, 5], [2]), ([7], [2]), ([9], [2]), ([12, 13], [2])]
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !####[([4], [3]), ([7, 8], [6])]
I do not like too much Windows 8 .####[([6, 7], [2, 3])]
Startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .####[([0, 1], [4])]
Also stunning colors and speedy####[([2], [1])]
great price free shipping what else can i ask for ! !####[([1], [0]), ([3], [2])]
This mouse is terrific .####[([1], [3])]
It is really thick around the battery .####[([6], [3])]
And windows 7 works like a charm .####[([1, 2], [6])]
: ) Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .####[([6], [5]), ([9], [8]), ([13], [12])]
: ] It arrived so fast and customer service was great .####[([7, 8], [10])]
tried windows 8 and hated it ! ! !####[([1, 2], [4])]
The price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .####[([1], [3])]
Set up was a breeze .####[([0, 1], [4])]
But I do NOT like Win8 .####[([5], [3, 4])]
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .####[([17], [14]), ([21, 22, 23], [19])]
I wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .####[([6], [16])]
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .####[([10], [14])]
I found the mini to be : Exceptionally easy to set up####[([10, 11], [8])]
The sound is nice and loud ; I do n't have any problems with hearing anything .####[([1], [5])]
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .####[([6, 7], [11])]
The settings are not user-friendly either .####[([1], [3, 4])]
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !####[([3], [1])]
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .####[([1, 2], [0]), ([5, 6], [4]), ([9], [8])]
i love the keyboard and the screen .####[([3], [1]), ([6], [1])]
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .####[([8], [14])]
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .####[([5], [9])]
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5 .####[([10], [0, 1, 2])]
thanks for great service and shipping !####[([3], [2]), ([5], [2])]
The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera .####[([1], [4]), ([7, 8], [12]), ([10], [12])]
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend .####[([9, 10, 11], [15])]
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .####[([13], [15, 16])]
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty .####[([6], [12])]
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , TOPS !####[([1], [6])]
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !####[([6], [9])]
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .####[([13], [12])]
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .####[([5], [7, 8, 9])]
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .####[([10, 11], [12, 13])]
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .####[([5], [3])]
Does everything I need it to , has a wonderful battery life and I could n't be happier .####[([10, 11], [9])]
Great Performance and Quality .####[([1], [0]), ([3], [0])]
One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .####[([44], [43])]
The new os is great on my macbook pro !####[([2], [4])]
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses .####[([9], [8])]
I have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .####[([6], [7, 8])]
System is running great .####[([0], [3])]
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .####[([2, 3], [0]), ([6, 7, 8, 9], [0])]
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .####[([10], [12]), ([14], [15])]
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .####[([2, 3], [1])]
Easy to set up and go !####[([2, 3], [0])]
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .####[([7, 8], [5]), ([15, 16], [12])]
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .####[([10], [11])]
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !####[([9], [18]), ([11], [18])]
It works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .####[([1], [2]), ([7], [12])]
I wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .####[([15], [14])]
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .####[([0], [3])]
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .####[([1, 2], [6])]
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .####[([8], [6])]
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .####[([14], [7, 8, 9]), ([18, 19, 20, 21], [23])]
I 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .####[([7], [11])]
I use it mostly for content creation ( Audio , video , photo editing ) and its reliable .####[([8], [17]), ([10], [17]), ([12, 13], [17])]
Screen is bright and gorgeous .####[([0], [4])]
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .####[([7], [6])]
It is fast and easy to use .####[([6], [4])]
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up####[([8, 9], [11, 12, 13])]
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help####[([13, 14, 15], [18, 19])]
Nice screen , keyboard works great !####[([1], [0]), ([3], [5])]
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was .####[([7], [5])]
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .####[([1], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11])]
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .####[([1], [2])]
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .####[([3], [1]), ([10], [5, 6, 7]), ([14], [12])]
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .####[([8], [10])]
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser .####[([0, 1], [4]), ([6, 7], [4])]
I like the lighted screen at night .####[([3, 4], [1])]
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .####[([5], [3]), ([11, 12], [9])]
I 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .####[([8], [7])]
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones .####[([0, 1], [4, 5])]
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .####[([10, 11], [8])]
The battery lasts as advertised ( give or take 15-20 minutes ) , and the entire user experience is very elegant .####[([16, 17], [20])]
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price .####[([4], [3]), ([7], [6])]
! Excellent performance , usability , presentation and time response .####[([2], [1]), ([4], [1]), ([6], [1]), ([8, 9], [1])]
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .####[([2], [5])]
I blame the Mac OS .####[([3, 4], [1])]
I like the operating system .####[([3, 4], [1])]
I love the form factor .####[([3, 4], [1])]
It 's fast at loading the internet .####[([4, 5, 6], [2])]
So much faster and sleeker looking .####[([5], [4])]
Unfortunately , it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April .####[([4], [0]), ([9], [8])]
First off , I really do like my MBP ... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .####[([14], [18]), ([25, 26], [28]), ([32], [37])]
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit .####[([6], [5])]
Very nice unibody construction .####[([2, 3], [1])]
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .####[([9], [13])]
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it .####[([8, 9], [4, 5, 6])]
There is no HDMI receptacle , nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device .####[([3, 4], [2]), ([10, 11, 12], [6])]
It came in brand new and works perfectly .####[([6], [7])]
It should n't happen like that , I do n't have any design app open or anything .####[([12, 13], [8, 9, 10])]
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING .####[([1], [3, 4])]
It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .####[([9], [8]), ([1], [4]), ([3], [4])]
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product .####[([0], [2])]
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .####[([2], [6, 7, 8]), ([7, 8], [6])]
The configuration is perfect for my needs .####[([1], [3])]
and the speakers is the worst ever .####[([2], [5])]
Its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! ..####[([12], [10]), ([21], [14])]
Web surfuring is smooth and seamless .####[([0, 1], [5])]
I 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .####[([6], [3]), ([9], [3])]
This item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .####[([8], [9]), ([15], [13]), ([17], [13])]
It was also suffering from hardware ( keyboard ) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .####[([13], [12]), ([16, 17], [15]), ([5, 6, 7, 8], [9])]
Runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !####[([0], [1])]
It 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .####[([8], [7])]
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous .####[([1], [4])]
It has a very high performance , just for what I needed for .####[([5], [4])]
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .####[([18, 19, 20, 21], [14]), ([15], [14])]
I just bought the new MacBook Pro , the 13 '' model , and I ca n't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports .####[([27, 28], [23])]
It is the perfect size and speed for me .####[([4], [3]), ([6], [3])]
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC ! !####[([1, 2], [4])]
My last laptop was a 17 '' ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .####[([12], [13])]
However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count ( pretty surprised ) , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .####[([10, 11, 12], [15]), ([21], [26])]
And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse .####[([6, 7], [5])]
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .####[([6], [5]), ([10], [9])]
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old HP laptop .####[([5, 6], [1]), ([13, 14], [11])]
Shipped very quickly and safely .####[([0], [4])]
The thunderbolt port is awesome !####[([1, 2], [4])]
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I 've ever put my hands on .####[([1], [4])]
It 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .####[([4, 5], [2]), ([8, 9], [2])]
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved .####[([3], [1]), ([6], [13, 14, 15, 16])]
There were small problems with Mac office .####[([5, 6], [3])]
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 '' Imacs .####[([10], [8])]
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .####[([5], [3]), ([8], [9])]
Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it .####[([0], [4]), ([14], [4])]
Note , however , that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection .####[([7, 8], [12, 13]), ([16, 17, 18], [12, 13])]
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it .####[([7], [14]), ([29], [26])]
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc####[([17], [19]), ([23], [24, 25, 26])]
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem .####[([21, 22], [11, 12, 13])]
It 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !####[([7], [5])]
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .####[([8], [6]), ([16], [2]), ([18], [2])]
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college : - )####[([4, 5], [0])]
I will not be using that slot again .####[([6], [2, 3, 4])]
The OS is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .####[([1], [14])]
They are simpler to use .####[([4], [2])]
! so nice .. stable .. fast .. now i got my SSD !####[([12], [6])]
I love the quick start up .####[([4, 5], [1])]
You just can not beat the functionality of an Apple device .####[([6], [2, 3, 4])]
Yet my mac continues to function properly .####[([5], [6])]
Graphics are much improved .####[([0], [3])]
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : Build Quality - Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .####[([12, 13], [7]), ([22, 23], [18, 19, 20])]
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity .####[([4, 5, 6], [3])]
Mac tutorials do help .####[([0, 1], [3])]
The technical support was not helpful as well .####[([1, 2], [4, 5])]
I got the new adapter and there was no change .####[([4], [8, 9])]
Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .####[([0, 1], [11])]
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .####[([1], [3]), ([10], [3])]
OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable .####[([0, 1], [8])]
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .####[([20], [21])]
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .####[([4, 5], [7])]
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason .####[([3], [13])]
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple 's previous laptops .####[([1, 2], [8])]
3D rendering slows it down considerably .####[([0, 1], [2, 3, 4])]
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098+ tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax- 1070- OTD !####[([3], [2]), ([6], [5])]
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .####[([2], [4, 5])]
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900+ level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU ( similar to the $ 799 Mini ) , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card ( this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card ) , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .####[([69], [68])]
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .####[([2], [15])]
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .####[([8], [9])]
This mac does come with an extender cable and I 'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac .####[([17], [20])]
The 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [5])]
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .####[([5, 6], [13])]
So noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .####[([10], [22]), ([1], [3])]
Not sure on Windows 8 .####[([3, 4], [0, 1])]
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive .####[([8, 9, 10], [7])]
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .####[([5, 6], [4]), ([8, 9], [4])]
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .####[([6], [5]), ([12], [5])]
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .####[([1, 2], [8])]
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .####[([6], [5])]
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .####[([7], [6])]
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .####[([12], [6])]
Runs very smoothly .####[([0], [2])]
Boot-up slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .####[([0], [1]), ([5, 6], [1])]
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .####[([18], [6]), ([20, 21], [6]), ([23, 24], [6]), ([26], [6])]
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install , but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu .####[([9], [7]), ([11], [7])]
Runs real quick .####[([0], [2])]
Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .####[([5], [7])]
WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .####[([3, 4], [18]), ([7, 8], [18]), ([0, 1], [18])]
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down ( the nail slot on the card can not be accessed ) , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .####[([1, 2, 3], [8, 9]), ([12, 13, 14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19, 20]), ([29], [35])]
Soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .####[([1], [0]), ([3, 4], [10, 11])]
Simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .####[([4], [3]), ([7], [11, 12])]
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .####[([14], [12])]
No HDMI port .####[([1, 2], [0])]
Customization on mac is impossible .####[([0], [4])]
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .####[([1, 2, 3], [13]), ([9, 10, 11], [14])]
The SuperDrive is quiet .####[([1], [3])]
The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .####[([1], [4])]
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .####[([3], [2])]
The OS is great .####[([1], [3])]
CONS : Price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .####[([2], [9])]
Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports .####[([8, 9, 10], [3, 4])]
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .####[([1, 2], [11])]
There is no `` tools '' menu .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [2])]
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .####[([13, 14], [10, 11])]
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch .####[([7, 8], [6])]
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8 .####[([3, 4], [5]), ([11, 12], [9, 10])]
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi .####[([2], [0]), ([15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [13])]
The speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker ... this is a great little laptop ... love it !####[([1], [5])]
Nice packing .####[([1], [0])]
I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows .####[([14], [13])]
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore , Apple does n't even offer it anymore !####[([4], [1, 2, 3])]
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .####[([3, 4], [2])]
At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system .####[([12, 13], [8])]
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS .####[([2], [3, 4, 5, 6]), ([14], [13]), ([18], [13])]
its as advertised on here ... .. it works great and is not a waste of money !####[([8], [9])]
Premium price for the OS more than anything else .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [0])]
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .####[([7, 8], [18])]
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27 '' iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers .####[([32], [29])]
The sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .####[([1], [5, 6, 7, 8])]
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times- sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .####[([1, 2], [22])]
However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .####[([8], [10, 11, 12])]
The battery is not as shown in the product photos .####[([1], [3, 4, 5])]
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...####[([0], [2])]
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .####[([1, 2, 3], [11])]
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .####[([9, 10], [6])]
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .####[([6, 7], [32]), ([18, 19], [32]), ([22, 23, 24], [32])]
Chatting with Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .####[([12, 13, 14], [11])]
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys ( but that was expected ) .####[([17], [12])]
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !####[([6], [2])]
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .####[([6], [4]), ([12, 13], [10])]
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .####[([2], [1]), ([4], [1])]
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .####[([7, 8], [2])]
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb .####[([1, 2], [4])]
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .####[([17], [4])]
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .####[([8], [12]), ([2], [12])]
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 `` Mountain Lion '' .####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [2])]
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .####[([17], [16])]
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 '' LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .####[([17, 18, 19, 20], [22, 23, 24])]
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .####[([3, 4], [2])]
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .####[([1, 2], [0]), ([22], [21])]
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer####[([1], [19]), ([1], [19])]
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .####[([15], [12])]
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time .####[([6], [5])]
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [16])]
Put a SSD and use a 21 '' LED screen , this set up is silky smooth !####[([12, 13], [15, 16])]
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .####[([1], [5]), ([24], [22]), ([16, 17, 18], [13])]
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .####[([20], [18]), ([32], [33])]
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port , HDMI , ethernet and 3 USB ports .####[([4], [6]), ([9, 10], [6]), ([12], [6]), ([14], [6]), ([17, 18], [6])]
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .####[([10, 11], [4])]
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .####[([7], [3])]
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazon.com than it was in the Mac store .####[([10], [9])]
The nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .####[([6, 7], [5]), ([11], [10])]
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .####[([7, 8], [4, 5]), ([16, 17, 18], [20, 21])]
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .####[([3], [1, 2]), ([5], [1, 2])]
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different .####[([27, 28], [39])]
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .####[([3], [2]), ([6], [8])]
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .####[([0], [6]), ([11], [10])]
I like the brightness and adjustments .####[([3], [1]), ([5], [1])]
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .####[([7, 8], [2])]
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .####[([12, 13], [4])]
The only thing I miss are the `` Home/End '' type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long .####[([7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [4])]
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .####[([12, 13], [8])]
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .####[([3], [2]), ([5], [2])]
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([7], [9]), ([12, 13], [16])]
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .####[([10, 11], [7])]
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .####[([6], [9]), ([12], [16])]
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .####[([1, 2], [12])]
I am loving the fast performance also .####[([5], [4])]
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the Mac OS ) and the range is poor .####[([8, 9], [7]), ([14, 15], [11]), ([19], [21])]
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .####[([10], [2])]
Fine if you have a touch screen .####[([5, 6], [0])]
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .####[([11], [12]), ([14, 15], [16])]
The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .####[([1], [10])]
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 ( in PC enabled with USB3 ) I was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .####[([4, 5], [11]), ([28, 29], [34])]
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .####[([2], [1]), ([6], [5]), ([16, 17], [15])]
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .####[([8, 9], [15])]
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .####[([6], [4])]
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .####[([16], [15])]
packing and everything was perfect####[([0], [4])]
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .####[([21, 22], [18])]
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .####[([9, 10], [17]), ([22, 23], [17])]
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .####[([36], [37])]
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .####[([8, 9, 10], [4])]
Cost is more as compared to other brands .####[([0], [2])]
also ... - excellent operating system -- size and weight for optimal mobility -- excellent durability of the battery -- the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand-####[([4, 5], [3]), ([7], [3]), ([9], [3]), ([12], [11]), ([15, 16, 17, 18], [14]), ([21, 22, 23, 24, 25], [27])]
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .####[([1], [5])]
I 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .####[([14], [11, 12]), ([16], [11, 12])]
the latest version does not have a disc drive .####[([7, 8], [4, 5])]
Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous .####[([0], [14]), ([9], [14])]
