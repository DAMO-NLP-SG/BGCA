It 's fast and has excellent battery life .####[([6, 7], [5])]
It is easy to navigate and update programs .####[([6, 7], [2]), ([4], [2])]
The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !####[([2], [1])]
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .####[([9, 10], [8])]
It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .####[([4], [3]), ([10], [9])]
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .####[([34], [39])]
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .####[([12, 13, 14], [2])]
Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .####[([8], [6, 7]), ([0], [1])]
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .####[([12], [11])]
The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .####[([6], [7])]
I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista .####[([2, 3], [1])]
Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .####[([0], [9, 10, 11])]
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .####[([28, 29], [26]), ([33], [26])]
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .####[([20, 21], [19])]
It was hard to handle and operate at school .####[([4], [2]), ([6], [2])]
The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .####[([1, 2], [17, 18]), ([1, 2], [17, 18])]
The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use , although very different than Win XP , Visa or Win7 .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [13])]
Also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .####[([9], [14])]
I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .####[([12, 13, 14, 15], [7])]
Maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .####[([0, 1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6])]
The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .####[([5], [4])]
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .####[([1, 2, 3], [6])]
After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro , the monitor has completely died .####[([14], [17])]
Charger seems large for this class of computer .####[([0], [2])]
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .####[([13, 14], [12])]
After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .####[([7, 8], [11]), ([25], [24])]
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .####[([21], [20]), ([23], [25]), ([27, 28], [29]), ([31, 32, 33], [34])]
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .####[([14, 15], [1])]
The price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .####[([1, 2], [6]), ([15], [18])]
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .####[([2, 3], [8])]
After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .####[([7], [11])]
lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from PC ;####[([3, 4], [2])]
iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC .####[([0], [2, 3])]
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for .####[([1, 2], [4])]
I especially like the backlit keyboard .####[([4, 5], [2])]
After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 '' MBP i5 .####[([9], [8])]
it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook .####[([7], [3])]
Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .####[([1], [3]), ([12, 13], [3]), ([17, 18], [15])]
HP said it was out of warranty .####[([6], [4, 5])]
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .####[([6], [2, 3])]
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .####[([2], [23])]
It 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .####[([2], [4]), ([6], [8])]
I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed .####[([15], [14])]
I was n't really as concerned about portability ( it 's a very large laptop ) but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .####[([7], [32, 33])]
At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again .####[([12, 13], [14])]
The right speaker did not work .####[([1, 2], [4, 5])]
Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled####[([3], [0]), ([5], [6])]
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY .####[([10, 11], [2, 3, 4])]
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .####[([49], [52]), ([27], [29])]
I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .####[([6], [22])]
The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X .####[([14, 15], [1])]
Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product ( my five year old Compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .####[([22, 23], [24])]
But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .####[([21], [6, 7, 8]), ([14, 15], [6, 7, 8]), ([17, 18, 19], [6, 7, 8])]
And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .####[([18, 19], [16]), ([9], [12])]
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs ( delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again ) , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .####[([12, 13], [15])]
They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .####[([5, 6], [4])]
Oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .####[([5, 6], [4])]
The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .####[([1], [2, 3, 4]), ([8], [10]), ([13], [14])]
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .####[([17], [15]), ([14], [15])]
The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !####[([7, 8], [5])]
Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .####[([7], [6]), ([11], [10]), ([18, 19], [17])]
The software is amazing .####[([1], [3])]
We carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the LCD just `` slide '' downwards .####[([17], [14])]
But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .####[([11], [13])]
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .####[([10, 11], [5])]
Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I 'm fixing that by adding more RAM .####[([18], [17])]
The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [8]), ([14], [3]), ([30], [3])]
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .####[([20], [19])]
I also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .####[([4], [2]), ([7], [2]), ([10], [2]), ([14, 15, 16], [18])]
It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz .####[([10, 11], [3])]
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .####[([3], [10, 11, 12]), ([6], [10, 11, 12])]
previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .####[([12, 13], [18]), ([19, 20], [18])]
In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .####[([15, 16], [4, 5])]
This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .####[([5], [4]), ([10], [9])]
The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !####[([1], [4, 5])]
Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .####[([14, 15], [13]), ([41], [54])]
The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .####[([1], [4])]
With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .####[([4, 5], [9])]
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .####[([13], [12])]
Awesome graphics !####[([1], [0])]
I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges .####[([17, 18], [14])]
All for such a great price .####[([5], [4])]
Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it .####[([0, 1, 2], [5])]
The brand is tarnished in my heart .####[([1], [3])]
the screen brightness automatically adjusts .####[([1, 2], [3, 4])]
The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .####[([1], [5, 6])]
The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to .####[([16], [28, 29])]
I dislike the weight and size , cubersome .####[([3], [7]), ([5], [7])]
The feel of this is better than the Toshiba , too .####[([1], [5])]
Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .####[([7, 8], [3]), ([15, 16], [13, 14]), ([5], [3])]
It was very easy to just pick up and use -- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS .####[([21, 22], [3]), ([9], [3])]
The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .####[([1, 2], [9, 10]), ([12], [9, 10]), ([6], [4])]
The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again !####[([1], [4])]
As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .####[([5], [10])]
Yes , I thought the expese was a little much , but I now realize you get what you pay for .####[([5], [9])]
It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .####[([14], [12])]
The battery gets so HOT it is scary .####[([1], [7])]
The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .####[([1], [2]), ([12, 13], [8])]
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .####[([7, 8, 9], [11])]
Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside .####[([2, 3], [1])]
Good monitor and performed well .####[([1], [0]), ([3], [4])]
WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !####[([2, 3], [8, 9, 10, 11])]
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .####[([4], [13]), ([8, 9], [13]), ([12], [13])]
Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price .####[([11], [10])]
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .####[([2], [8]), ([16], [10])]
Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior .####[([28], [36])]
The screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .####[([1], [10])]
the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .####[([18], [17])]
Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .####[([12], [13])]
It was secure and easy to navigate .####[([6], [4])]
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .####[([15], [14])]
Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !####[([0, 1], [2, 3, 4]), ([9], [18])]
However , my girlfriend realized that the netbook 's hinge is a bit loose ( when you open or close the LCD ) .####[([9], [13])]
The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6])]
The price is great for this model , I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .####[([1], [3])]
Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .####[([7], [9])]
Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .####[([1], [3])]
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both !####[([15], [16])]
If you really want a bang-up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple ;####[([6], [5])]
Its Office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .####[([6], [12]), ([9], [12]), ([1], [2])]
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .####[([4, 5], [2])]
On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I did n't like the trackpad .####[([9], [6, 7]), ([22], [18, 19, 20])]
EITHER WAY , THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY .####[([4], [6, 7])]
All apple associates are always willing to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .####[([1, 2], [5])]
Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to Windows 7 Professional was a snap ;####[([13, 14, 15], [18])]
Then I 've fixed the DC jack ( inside the unit ) , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .####[([5, 6], [3]), ([15, 16], [13]), ([26, 27], [24])]
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming .####[([1], [14, 15, 16])]
It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for Microsoft office .####[([2], [4])]
Yeah , of course smarty pants `` fix it now '' ) Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple ( which I promptly did ) .####[([23, 24], [25]), ([12], [4])]
Well , I have to say since I bought my Mac , I wo n't ever go back to any Windows .####[([20], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17])]
Once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .####[([4, 5], [7, 8])]
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the `` repair '' .####[([11], [12])]
The ease of use is wonderful .####[([3], [5])]
It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .####[([2], [3, 4, 5])]
Images are crisp and clean .####[([0], [4])]
The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications .####[([1], [6]), ([9], [6])]
Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .####[([2], [3])]
I love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I 've used .####[([4, 5, 6], [3]), ([10], [13])]
MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .####[([9, 10], [8]), ([18], [17])]
2nd Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into####[([21], [18, 19, 20])]
The first one sent : Touchpad did n't work The second sent : USB did n't work The third sent : Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent : Has n't arrived yet .####[([5], [6, 7, 8]), ([13], [14, 15, 16]), ([5], [6, 7, 8])]
It works really well .####[([1], [3])]
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .####[([33], [35])]
It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well .####[([5], [4]), ([8], [11])]
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG . THE PRODUCT KEY .####[([10, 11], [2])]
The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person , I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .####[([1], [5]), ([3], [5])]
-I propose that they can just swap the hard drives .####[([8, 9], [6])]
They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .####[([4], [3])]
Its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .####[([6], [3])]
The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .####[([1, 2], [4, 5, 6])]
See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .####[([14, 15], [13])]
All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .####[([8], [24]), ([10], [24])]
Windows 7 Starter is terrific ( no you ca n't change the background ) but I do n't need to , I use it just for school work .####[([0, 1, 2], [4])]
Though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to ( CS5 ) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .####[([7, 8], [23, 24, 25]), ([2], [23, 24, 25]), ([4], [23, 24, 25])]
And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .####[([15], [18])]
The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried .####[([9], [7])]
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .####[([11], [6, 7])]
My one complaint with this laptop is that I 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .####[([12, 13, 14], [2]), ([19, 20], [2])]
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .####[([0], [2])]
It is light and the battery last a very long time .####[([5], [9])]
It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something .####[([13], [3])]
I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .####[([7], [5]), ([12], [11])]
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently .####[([2, 3], [10]), ([7, 8, 9], [10])]
I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .####[([9], [12])]
I love the glass touchpad .####[([3, 4], [1])]
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .####[([5, 6], [2])]
It did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .####[([6], [1, 2, 3, 4]), ([16], [21])]
the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .####[([1], [3]), ([12], [11])]
It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .####[([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [3])]
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .####[([0], [2]), ([7, 8], [12])]
So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool ? The after sales support is terrible .####[([12, 13, 14], [16]), ([6], [9])]
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services .####[([1, 2], [4])]
The quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .####[([1], [8]), ([3, 4], [8]), ([6], [8])]
We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .####[([6], [5])]
Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience .####[([14, 15], [17])]
Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .####[([16], [17])]
The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge ( the edges hurt my wrists ) .####[([25], [24])]
Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .####[([14], [12])]
A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .####[([10, 11], [2])]
Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .####[([3, 4, 5], [8])]
-- No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .####[([3], [1])]
It has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .####[([23], [21]), ([5], [4])]
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .####[([9], [10, 11])]
It 's color is even cool .####[([2], [5])]
After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .####[([18], [21])]
the laptop preformed pretty well .####[([2], [4])]
The graphics are stunning .####[([1], [3])]
Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ) .####[([0], [5, 6])]
Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .####[([3], [15, 16, 17, 18])]
It rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .####[([2], [1])]
Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .####[([17], [20])]
and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen ) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .####[([2, 3, 4], [28])]
Love the speed , especially !####[([2], [0])]
It is super easy to use .####[([5], [3])]
My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .####[([11, 12], [17])]
Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside .####[([9], [7]), ([12], [7])]
Even out of warranty !####[([3], [1, 2])]
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .####[([1], [7]), ([10], [9]), ([12], [9])]
wonderful features .####[([1], [0])]
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program .####[([14, 15], [2]), ([21, 22], [2])]
The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .####[([1], [5])]
I took it in to the Apple store and guess what ? They fixed it , no cost out of pocket .####[([17], [16])]
For the { $ } price ( special offer ) this is a great laptop .####[([5], [13])]
I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .####[([4], [2]), ([9], [7, 8])]
Suffice it to say , my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .####[([14, 15], [13]), ([18], [17])]
The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .####[([1], [12])]
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it 's spec quite easily .####[([2, 3], [1]), ([14], [16])]
I thought the price was great for the specs .####[([3], [5]), ([8], [5])]
My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensive laptop that did not work after 2 days .####[([17], [16])]
1.You can not change your desktop background ( window 's 7 starter does NOT support that function ) .####[([5, 6], [1, 2, 3]), ([8, 9, 10, 11], [13, 14]), ([16], [13, 14])]
The only downfall is the volume control .####[([5, 6], [2])]

It is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be 'corrupted ' .####[([4], [2]), ([7], [2])]
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .####[([5, 6], [9])]
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !####[([1], [3])]

While Apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .####[([19], [21])]
At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high-end specs for a low , low price .####[([12], [11]), ([18], [17])]
Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the household .####[([7], [5])]
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .####[([11], [5]), ([34], [32])]
Strengths : Well -- shaped Weaknesses : A bad videocard !####[([9], [8]), ([4], [2])]

They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist .####[([43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48], [39])]
The only bad part is the size / weight .####[([6], [2]), ([8], [2])]
From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .####[([2, 3], [13]), ([6], [13])]

Finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .####[([7, 8], [4])]
Treat yourself to a more expensive , long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony , Apple , or Toshiba .####[([10], [7])]
I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .####[([11], [7])]
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .####[([20, 21], [26])]

I would like to use a different operating system altogether .####[([7, 8], [6])]
I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .####[([15], [1])]
But with A WAY Bigger Screen , and IS able to connect to an HDMI .####[([5], [4]), ([14], [9, 10, 11])]
Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the `` human interface .####[([6], [4, 5]), ([13, 14], [4, 5])]
The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .####[([9, 10], [6])]
For some odd reasons the computer does n't recognize the operation system .####[([10, 11], [6, 7, 8])]
I had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop .####[([8, 9], [12])]
Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently .####[([7], [8])]
It runs perfectly .####[([1], [2])]
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys .####[([24], [21])]
The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .####[([6, 7, 8], [10, 11])]
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers .####[([10], [8]), ([14], [12])]
It is very well built .####[([4], [3])]
I also liked the glass screen .####[([4, 5], [2])]
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .####[([10], [7]), ([16, 17], [13])]
System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .####[([7], [2]), ([0], [2])]
The battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .####[([1, 2], [12, 13])]
It 's wonderful for computer gaming .####[([5], [2])]
iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .####[([0], [10]), ([5], [3])]
I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !####[([6], [10])]
The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .####[([1], [5]), ([11, 12], [9])]
Simple to use , and great graphics .####[([6], [5]), ([2], [0])]
It was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !####[([10], [11])]
Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English .####[([15], [12, 13, 14])]
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .####[([28], [27])]
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .####[([29], [28])]
It 's also fairly easy to use the Operating System .####[([8, 9], [4])]
Sound card is limited though .####[([0, 1], [3])]
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV .####[([5, 6], [3]), ([9, 10], [3])]
It is not ideal for children because of the temp .####[([9], [2, 3])]
Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .####[([3], [5]), ([13], [12])]
The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .####[([1], [3])]
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [7, 8])]
Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .####[([2], [5])]
Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems , as well .####[([0], [6])]
I do n't have stupid pop up windows ( even when I have pop ups blocked ) , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .####[([5, 6, 7], [4]), ([41, 42, 43], [33])]
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .####[([8, 9], [12]), ([17, 18], [19])]
This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !####[([8, 9], [11])]
Keyboard is reasonable size .####[([0], [2, 3]), ([3], [2])]
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home .####[([5, 6, 7, 8], [11])]
Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .####[([1, 2], [0])]
They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything !####[([38, 39], [40, 41, 42, 43]), ([32], [30, 31, 32, 33])]
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .####[([8, 9], [7])]
The laptop was very easy to set up .####[([6, 7], [4])]
The ease of set up was terrific .####[([3, 4], [6])]
the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro .####[([1, 2], [12])]
Laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?####[([15], [14])]
It 's like 9 punds , but if you can look past it , it 's GREAT !####[([3, 4], [16])]
Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .####[([7], [8, 9]), ([7], [8, 9]), ([20], [19])]
it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .####[([4], [3]), ([9], [8]), ([26], [25]), ([31], [29])]
It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .####[([7], [4])]
I 've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory .####[([6, 7], [3]), ([10], [14]), ([17], [14])]
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .####[([10, 11], [8, 9])]
It works fine with our wireless and they 've had not problems .####[([1], [2])]
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .####[([5], [2])]
The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate .####[([1], [3])]
Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .####[([0], [5])]
Most everything is fine with this machine : speed , capacity , build .####[([8], [3]), ([10], [3]), ([12], [3])]
The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it .####[([8, 9, 10], [13]), ([27], [26])]
It did not have all the features I expected it to have .####[([6], [1, 2, 3])]
One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .####[([6], [1])]
Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .####[([2], [0])]
The battery is really long .####[([1], [4])]
So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff ) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .####[([22], [17])]
I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .####[([6, 7], [1]), ([13], [1])]
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i 'm thrilled with that .####[([1, 2], [5])]
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .####[([9, 10], [11])]
In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .####[([8], [17]), ([10], [17])]
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .####[([13], [4]), ([16], [4])]
Info : Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .####[([2], [3]), ([8], [13])]
I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : )####[([3], [11])]
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .####[([5, 6], [10, 11, 12, 13])]
tons of bloatware and junk programs .####[([5], [4])]
Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .####[([5, 6], [16])]
Also the display is exceptional !####[([2], [4])]
Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .####[([7], [0])]
A cheaper price should not equal a `` cheap '' product .####[([2], [1])]
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop .####[([4, 5], [2])]
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista ( I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system ) .####[([10], [5])]
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features .####[([8], [1]), ([15], [14])]
First the screen goes completely out .####[([2], [4, 5])]
Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .####[([1], [5])]
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .####[([6, 7], [9, 10])]
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .####[([20], [17]), ([39, 40], [38])]
In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .####[([11, 12], [10])]
Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .####[([0], [1])]
Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst .####[([6], [10])]
The keyboard is too slick .####[([1], [4])]
The program came with the computer and works beautifully .####[([1], [8])]
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .####[([17], [15, 16]), ([22, 23], [25])]
The driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .####[([1, 2], [10])]
While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at , I think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs .####[([16], [14])]
The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .####[([2, 3], [5])]
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it .####[([11], [13])]
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got ( that WAS worth the money ) , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the Docking port .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [3]), ([10], [19]), ([13], [19])]
also the battery is completely shot .####[([2], [4, 5])]
Games being the main issue .####[([0], [4])]
My ONLY issues are : 1 ) the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60####[([8, 9], [10, 11, 12])]
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .####[([3], [0]), ([6], [9])]
Also , I have had a lot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .####[([11, 12], [8])]
So what am I supposed to do ? The LG service center can not provide me the `` service '' when it is called the `` service center '' .####[([10, 11], [12, 13, 14])]
The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .####[([1], [2, 3]), ([8], [10, 11])]
The graphics are great .####[([1], [3])]
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .####[([9], [21])]
The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [15, 16])]
The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .####[([1, 2, 3], [11])]
It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .####[([5, 6], [19]), ([11, 12], [19]), ([14, 15], [19])]
Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .####[([12, 13], [5])]
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .####[([9, 10], [8])]
I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return .####[([8, 9, 10], [4])]
I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models .####[([9], [10])]
Needs longer lasting battery , More than 1 to 2 Hrs .####[([3], [1])]
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !####[([1], [3])]
For the not so good , I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy .####[([9, 10], [15])]
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive .####[([1], [6])]
So , after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .####[([6, 7], [20])]
Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .####[([4, 5, 6], [10]), ([0], [1])]
I also got the added bonus of a 30 '' HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !####[([8, 9, 10, 11], [4, 5]), ([19], [17])]
The battery life was shorter than expected .####[([1, 2], [4])]
GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING ! ! !####[([7], [6])]
Speakers does n't sound that great .####[([0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]
It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .####[([4, 5], [2, 3])]
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .####[([10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16])]
Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .####[([0], [2])]
After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .####[([11, 12], [10])]
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive ( I do n't really understand why but anyway ) .####[([7], [5])]
Delivery was early too .####[([0], [2])]
Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .####[([22], [23])]
Great product by Apple with the new great looking design .####[([9], [7])]
the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .####[([1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]), ([11], [12, 13, 14])]
Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .####[([16], [14])]
and plenty of storage with 250 gb ( though I will upgrade this and the ram.. )####[([3], [1])]
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in .####[([5], [2])]
It 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network .####[([10, 11], [8]), ([15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [13])]
Besides the great look , it is a great machine .####[([3], [2])]
It discharges too quickly .####[([1], [3])]
AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) !####[([12], [11])]
But the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .####[([2], [7, 8, 9, 10])]
Its fast , has High definition quality in the videos .####[([4, 5, 6], [4])]
Supplied software : The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with .####[([0, 1], [11, 12]), ([4], [11, 12])]
Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .####[([5], [4])]
The PhotoBooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera .####[([1], [4]), ([5], [4]), ([14, 15], [10])]
while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .####[([2], [5]), ([8], [12]), ([22, 23, 24], [17, 18])]
Very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) .####[([2], [1])]
Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ( ie Internet tabs , programs , etc ) simultaneously .####[([9], [8])]
I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found .####[([10], [12])]
Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough screen to get everything done .####[([18], [16])]
The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .####[([1, 2], [4])]
In due course , I 'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .####[([8, 9], [6])]
While it was highly rated , would I like it ? I tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok .####[([14], [22])]
I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use .####[([4, 5], [1]), ([12], [10])]
I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike .####[([2], [10]), ([11], [10])]
I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !####[([2, 3], [9]), ([5], [9])]
It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .####[([6, 7, 8], [5])]
The price was very good , and the product is top quality .####[([1], [4]), ([11], [10])]
The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .####[([1, 2], [9]), ([4], [9]), ([7], [9])]
Was not happy with one of the programs on it .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [1, 2])]
`` This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output .####[([22, 23], [13])]
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price####[([5], [4]), ([10], [9])]
A month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .####[([8], [10])]
You wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .####[([12, 13], [11])]
Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .####[([13], [12]), ([19], [18])]
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks , and I am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .####[([19], [13]), ([22], [13])]
There is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .####[([3, 4], [2])]
The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !####[([2], [10]), ([4], [10])]
The system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .####[([6, 7], [10]), ([13], [15, 16]), ([20, 21], [35]), ([1], [3])]
I 've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense .####[([7], [8])]
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .####[([10], [0])]
Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling .####[([0], [4, 5])]
The price and features more than met my needs .####[([1], [4]), ([3], [4])]
This computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .####[([9], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6])]
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .####[([3, 4], [28, 29])]
Even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .####[([5], [10])]
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .####[([12], [2, 3]), ([16], [2, 3])]
I take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .####[([12], [10])]
the mouse buttons are hard to push .####[([1, 2], [4])]
`` > iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with : easy and convenient .####[([2], [16])]
Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker .####[([21, 22], [24])]
i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .####[([11], [25])]
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine .####[([5], [13]), ([10], [13])]
As a user of a PC , I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself `` Getting the job done quicker .####[([18, 19], [17])]
great battery life .####[([1, 2], [0])]
It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .####[([2], [9]), ([4], [9])]
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .####[([11, 12], [10])]
Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked .####[([7, 8], [6])]
It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .####[([3], [4, 5]), ([8], [11])]
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .####[([7, 8], [0])]
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most .####[([1], [8])]
It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .####[([13], [12]), ([5], [3])]
And the ram ( the thing that makes it faster ) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .####[([2], [9]), ([17], [16]), ([25, 26, 27], [31])]
The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .####[([1], [9])]
Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .####[([2], [4, 5, 6])]
I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .####[([4], [9]), ([11], [9])]
The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .####[([1, 2], [4, 5])]
The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .####[([18], [20, 21, 22])]
Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .####[([2], [13]), ([7, 8], [13])]
We love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [1]), ([17], [15])]
With the macbook pro it comes with free security software to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .####[([8, 9], [7])]
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .####[([9], [13]), ([11, 12], [13])]
The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .####[([4, 5], [8]), ([14, 15], [13])]
This is a great value for the money .####[([4], [3])]
My computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .####[([8], [12, 13])]
This computer I used daily nice compact design .####[([7], [6])]
I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing .####[([14], [7])]
The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room .####[([2], [1])]
The Apple will run Internet Explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .####[([4, 5], [11])]
I previously purchased a 13 '' macbook ( had pro specs and was aluminum style ) which had a nvidia 9800 ( If I am not mistaken ) and it had major heating issues .####[([19, 20], [33])]
So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .####[([15], [13, 14])]
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .####[([1], [4])]
( No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way .####[([7], [1, 2])]
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system .####[([5, 6], [2]), ([8, 9], [2]), ([2], [0])]
When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great .####[([5, 6], [8, 9])]
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .####[([8], [7])]
The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .####[([1], [12])]
When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .####[([30, 31], [26, 27, 28])]
The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .####[([1, 2], [3])]
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .####[([24], [23])]
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .####[([9], [14])]
The battery has never worked well .####[([1], [3, 4, 5])]
Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .####[([0, 1], [3])]
Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .####[([18], [22])]
The battery life , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired .####[([1, 2], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16])]
Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage ( keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in ) , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .####[([16], [17]), ([19, 20], [21, 22]), ([25], [26, 27]), ([29, 30], [31])]
But , for the cost this is a winner .####[([4], [8])]
I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 '' macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .####[([28, 29], [30, 31])]
It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .####[([4], [2]), ([8, 9], [6]), ([13], [12])]
Not too much `` junk '' software to remove .####[([6], [4])]
The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it ( iPhoto , iMovie , iWeb , iTunes , GarageBand ) is all very helpful as well .####[([10, 11], [30]), ([17], [30]), ([19], [30]), ([21], [30]), ([23], [30]), ([25], [30]), ([2], [4])]
Yes , a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .####[([21], [18, 19]), ([23], [18, 19])]
It was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .####[([11], [8])]
The games included are very good games .####[([6], [5])]
The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;####[([1], [8])]
No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it `` could be a problem with the bios '' How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ? ? ! !####[([9], [3, 4, 5, 6]), ([19], [16])]
The computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening Word or My Computer .####[([2], [4])]
Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .####[([9], [8])]
It has a lot of memory and a great battery life .####[([5], [2, 3, 4]), ([9, 10], [8])]
it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .####[([6], [11]), ([19, 20], [11]), ([15, 16], [11])]
The keyboard is top notch .####[([1], [3, 4])]
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .####[([0], [10])]
Also , the battery does not last very long at all .####[([3], [8])]
Was very much worth the price i paid .####[([5], [3])]
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .####[([28], [27])]
I can not be happier with the service or product .####[([7], [1, 2, 3, 4])]
The touchpad is extremely sensitive , which is the only drawback .####[([1], [10])]
I love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .####[([3], [7])]
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [7, 8])]
This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .####[([8, 9], [4]), ([11, 12], [4])]
The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior .####[([1], [12])]
I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .####[([3, 4], [15, 16])]
The battery life is amazing , the versitility is outstanding .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([7], [9])]
My only disappointment with the 13 '' model is that they 're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards , however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life ( of about 2 more hours ) .####[([26], [21]), ([29, 30], [21]), ([41, 42], [40])]
The minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .####[([13, 14], [12])]
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .####[([1, 2], [16]), ([12], [10])]
I am ADDICTED to photo booth !####[([4, 5], [2])]
The Apple applications ( ex . iPhoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to use ( unlike the competition ) !####[([1, 2], [15]), ([6], [15])]
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it 's a snap .####[([13], [12])]
The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .####[([1], [2, 3])]
I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !####[([5, 6], [4])]
Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .####[([12], [11]), ([4, 5, 6], [11])]
Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel , sound quality , etc .####[([5, 6], [2, 3]), ([8, 9], [2, 3]), ([1], [2, 3])]
Design : very durable .####[([0], [3])]
I 'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it ( that 's about how long the port seems to last ) .####[([26], [17])]
The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel .####[([1, 2, 3], [10])]
Beta had better quality , but VHS became the industry standard .####[([3], [2]), ([6], [2])]
Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .####[([3, 4], [7])]
Screen is awesome , battery life is good .####[([0], [2]), ([4, 5], [7])]
Enabling the battery timer is useless .####[([2, 3], [5])]
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .####[([18], [17]), ([20], [17]), ([4], [3])]
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .####[([2, 3, 4], [7])]
So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .####[([3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9])]
I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life ( for now ) .####[([4], [3]), ([7], [6]), ([10, 11], [9])]
However , I love this particular Mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad .####[([13], [12]), ([18], [17]), ([21, 22], [17]), ([25, 26], [24])]
since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .####[([9], [8])]
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .####[([2], [1])]
There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer .####[([12], [7, 8])]
I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .####[([33], [29]), ([35], [29]), ([37], [29])]
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak .####[([9], [12])]
I have never really been big on downloading anything so I was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus I thought I was protected by Norton .####[([27], [25])]
It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .####[([11, 12, 13, 14], [21])]
It doesnt work worth a damn .####[([2], [5])]
( I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $ 50 ) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .####[([21], [19])]
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .####[([0], [8])]
It runs very quiet too which is a plus .####[([1], [8])]
Summary : I 've had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .####[([16, 17], [18, 19])]
Love the graphics , awesome programs ( including Garageband ) , and really cool default background .####[([2], [0]), ([5], [4]), ([8], [4]), ([14, 15], [13])]
I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .####[([3], [1]), ([19], [1])]
When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .####[([20], [21])]
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .####[([1], [3, 4, 5]), ([5], [3])]
The keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard , now looks terrible .####[([1], [18])]
You know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are playing games or working with photos .####[([17, 18], [10, 11])]
But we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .####[([5], [10])]
There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark .####[([3, 4], [7])]
The display on this computer is the best I 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convenient .####[([1], [7]), ([18, 19], [25])]
Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .####[([7, 8], [10])]
I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations .####[([12], [2, 3])]
I love the size , keyboard , the functions .####[([3], [1]), ([5], [1]), ([8], [1])]
Very fast boot up and shut down .####[([2, 3], [1]), ([5, 6], [1])]
However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .####[([12, 13], [14])]
Waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .####[([13], [9]), ([3], [5, 6])]
2.The wireless card is low quality .####[([1, 2], [4, 5])]
Downfalls : sharp edges .####[([3], [2])]
They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .####[([16], [13])]
Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card .####[([5], [7, 8]), ([25, 26, 27], [22])]
I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !####[([25], [24])]
I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident ! ! !####[([19, 20], [16])]
Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography .####[([2, 3, 4], [6])]
The next time I had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .####[([8], [9, 10, 11])]
But guess what ? ( you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type ) The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .####[([10, 11, 12], [14, 15, 16]), ([36, 37], [30, 31, 32])]
Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .####[([8], [13])]
Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .####[([3], [21])]
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .####[([8], [7])]
I liked the aluminum body .####[([3, 4], [1])]
There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook !####[([5], [7])]
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .####[([8], [9, 10, 11, 12])]
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .####[([9, 10], [1]), ([3], [1])]
What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .####[([9], [10])]
It is a REAL touchpad , not the toy I saw in other brands .####[([4], [3])]
It really is perfect for work and play .####[([7], [3]), ([5], [3])]
It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others .####[([4], [3]), ([8], [3]), ([10], [3])]
*= Webcam is a bit laggy , not the greatest .####[([1], [7, 8, 9])]
I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS####[([7, 8], [13])]
3 ) Horrible customer support####[([3, 4], [2])]
The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .####[([4], [11])]
I am most impressed with the programming , including the iPhoto .####[([6], [3]), ([10], [3])]
I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV .####[([7, 8, 9], [6])]
Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel .####[([17], [16]), ([22, 23], [21])]
Great Laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .####[([4], [0]), ([9, 10, 11], [7]), ([6], [7])]
I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot .####[([7], [6]), ([13, 14, 15, 16], [20])]
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .####[([1], [4]), ([5], [4]), ([16, 17], [21])]
Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .####[([6], [2])]
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .####[([0, 1, 2], [4])]
I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it .####[([3, 4], [1])]
The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo ! Mail .####[([10, 11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16, 17])]
Great battery , speed , display .####[([1], [0]), ([3], [0]), ([5], [0])]
Also , I have had a lot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .####[([11], [15, 16, 17])]
Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .####[([2, 3], [0])]
They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board .####[([3, 4], [1]), ([9, 10], [1])]
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .####[([16, 17], [15])]
All in all , a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service .####[([20, 21], [6])]
The touch pad is among the best .####[([1, 2], [6])]
) And printing from either word processor is an adventure .####[([5, 6], [9])]

I use a cooling pad but it does n't help .####[([3, 4], [7, 8, 9])]
All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .####[([2], [6, 7])]

I was sorely disapointed to discover that HP ( what I thought was a reputable company ) would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .####[([21], [2, 3]), ([24, 25], [26, 27])]
They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with .####[([6], [5])]

It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .####[([9, 10], [6, 7])]
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google `` dell coupons '' you can find codes that take a significant amount off the price .####[([26], [28])]
