The food here was mediocre at best .####[([1], [4])]
It was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ... .####[([5, 6, 7], [3])]
Tasty Dog !####[([1], [0])]
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .####[([3], [2]), ([10], [8, 9])]

Favorite Sushi in NYC####[([1], [0])]
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .####[([2], [1]), ([8], [11]), ([14], [20])]
In the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .####[([6, 7, 8], [11])]
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .####[([1], [3]), ([20, 21], [19])]

Best Indian Restaurant in the City####[([1, 2], [0])]
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !####[([0], [4]), ([7], [9])]
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .####[([11], [10])]
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####[([7], [4]), ([24, 25], [20]), ([27], [20]), ([36], [34, 35])]
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [8])]

The stuff tilapia was horrid ... tasted like cardboard .####[([1, 2], [4])]
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .####[([6, 7], [9])]
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([8], [10, 11, 12])]
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing .####[([1], [10]), ([17, 18, 19], [21])]
However , our main course was wonderful .####[([3, 4], [6])]
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .####[([2], [13, 14, 15]), ([8], [13, 14, 15])]
The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .####[([6, 7], [10]), ([18], [20, 21, 22])]
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .####[([12], [4])]
All in all , I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####[([13], [12])]
short and sweet – seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private .####[([4], [6])]
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .####[([1], [18])]
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####[([1], [6]), ([11, 12], [8, 9]), ([25], [19, 20])]

They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .####[([3], [2]), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [15])]
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####[([18], [15, 16]), ([1, 2], [8]), ([5, 6], [8])]
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .####[([4, 5, 6], [3]), ([13, 14, 15], [12])]

I 've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .####[([7, 8], [12])]

The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .####[([1, 2], [5]), ([10], [26]), ([30, 31], [26])]
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being Indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .####[([18], [29])]
I was speechless by the horrible food .####[([6], [5])]
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####[([11], [14])]

This establishment is the real deal .####[([1], [4, 5])]
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####[([13], [12])]
Look , the appetizers were really good .####[([3], [6])]

Bison was quite excellent however .####[([0], [3])]
Dessert : pure disaster .####[([0], [3])]
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####[([6], [8])]
All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .####[([5], [7])]
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .####[([1], [4])]
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####[([6], [12])]
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####[([10], [12])]

I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####[([8, 9, 10], [14])]
The place is beautiful !####[([1], [3])]
The hostess was very pleasant .####[([1], [4])]
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !####[([5], [8])]
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####[([6], [11])]
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####[([1], [3])]
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####[([42], [41])]
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####[([21], [23])]
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .####[([5], [11])]
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .####[([1], [4])]
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####[([4], [11])]
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [0, 1])]
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####[([11, 12, 13, 14], [16])]
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####[([1, 2], [14])]
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .####[([3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [12])]
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !####[([6], [3]), ([14, 15, 16], [19])]
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .####[([3, 4], [6])]

I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####[([8], [5]), ([10], [5])]
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[([38], [52]), ([15, 16], [7])]
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[([24], [12])]
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .####[([6], [20])]
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner####[([1], [2])]
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####[([10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [17]), ([4, 5, 6], [3])]

I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .####[([3, 4, 5], [2])]
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .####[([1], [3]), ([7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14])]

A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .####[([2, 3, 4, 5], [1])]
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####[([1], [8]), ([12], [14]), ([26], [28])]
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####[([4, 5], [2])]
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City####[([4], [3])]
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####[([5, 6, 7], [26])]
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####[([11], [10]), ([25], [24])]
If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####[([27, 28], [25])]
My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####[([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [15])]
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####[([6, 7, 8], [5])]
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .####[([3, 4, 5], [13]), ([19, 20, 21], [23])]
The sake ’ s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .####[([1, 2, 3], [8])]
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [14]), ([17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], [29])]
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie .####[([43], [39])]
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6])]
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[([11], [10])]

Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####[([9, 10], [8]), ([12, 13], [8]), ([15, 16, 17], [8])]

Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .####[([5], [7])]
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...####[([5], [4]), ([30, 31], [36])]
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .####[([1], [3, 4]), ([7], [10])]
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .####[([3, 4], [10, 11, 12])]
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .####[([1], [11])]
Good Food####[([1], [0])]
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .####[([1], [5]), ([9, 10], [12, 13])]
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .####[([8], [7])]
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .####[([5], [12])]
The atmosphere was great .####[([1], [3])]
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####[([1], [5])]
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####[([1], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11])]
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####[([12], [8])]
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####[([1], [8])]
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####[([2], [3]), ([17], [21])]
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .####[([2], [6])]
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )####[([5], [4]), ([9], [8]), ([20, 21], [19])]
Everything was going good until we got our meals .####[([8], [3])]
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .####[([6], [10])]
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####[([12], [11])]
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####[([26], [35])]
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .####[([24], [26])]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .####[([10], [7])]
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####[([25], [22]), ([27], [22])]
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .####[([1], [4])]
cirspy crust margherita pizza####[([2, 3], [1])]
it was really good pizza .####[([4], [3])]
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )####[([1], [4, 5]), ([7], [9, 10])]
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan####[([2], [1])]
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####[([10], [9]), ([13], [12]), ([15], [12]), ([18, 19], [24])]
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####[([5], [4])]
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !####[([1], [7]), ([22], [21])]
Great Hot Dogs !####[([1, 2], [0])]
The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !####[([1, 2], [4, 5]), ([10], [12])]
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####[([2], [5])]
But nonetheless -- great spot , great food .####[([4], [3]), ([7], [6])]
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –####[([1], [0])]
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .####[([14], [18]), ([7, 8, 9, 10], [32]), ([42, 43], [41])]
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[([21, 22, 23, 24], [18])]
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####[([3], [1])]
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[([6], [3])]
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####[([3], [42])]
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .####[([14], [12, 13])]
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .####[([1], [5]), ([3], [5]), ([9], [14])]
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####[([8, 9, 10], [7])]
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####[([49], [45])]
Best meal in a long time !####[([1], [0])]
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .####[([0], [4]), ([2], [4])]
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .####[([3, 4], [7])]
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .####[([4, 5], [9])]
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .####[([0, 1, 2, 3], [6])]
The food is great and the environment is even better .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [9])]
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####[([2, 3], [5])]
Great Atmosphere####[([1], [0])]
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####[([4, 5], [2])]
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####[([1], [0])]
Poor service and management####[([1], [0]), ([3], [0])]
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .####[([5, 6, 7], [2])]
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####[([1], [3])]
Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####[([8], [6])]
The food is very good , but not outstanding .####[([1], [7, 8])]
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [10])]
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .####[([1], [3, 4])]
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####[([1], [3])]
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####[([18], [19])]
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .####[([8], [7]), ([11, 12], [10])]
bad staff####[([1], [0])]
I generally like this place .####[([4], [2])]
The food is good .####[([1], [3])]
The design of the space is good .####[([4], [6])]
But the service is HORRID !####[([2], [4])]
