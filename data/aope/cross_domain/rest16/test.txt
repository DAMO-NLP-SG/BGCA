This is a great place to get a delicious meal .####[([9], [8])]
The staff is pretty friendly .####[([1], [4])]
The onion rings are great !####[([1, 2], [4])]
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you ... ..were not good .####[([1, 2], [6]), ([10, 11, 12], [22, 23])]
Nice ambience , but highly overrated place .####[([1], [0]), ([6], [5])]
Worst Service I Ever Had####[([1], [0])]
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .####[([13], [12])]
Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .####[([1], [3])]

Caution - its real food for people who love the best .####[([4], [10])]
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .####[([3], [1]), ([8], [10, 11, 12, 13])]
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .####[([14], [18])]
Rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .####[([0], [2, 3]), ([5], [6, 7, 8, 9])]
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .####[([15], [18])]
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .####[([5], [9])]
Furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .####[([4], [7]), ([9], [14])]
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .####[([1], [6])]
On a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .####[([6], [9])]
Freshest sushi – I love this restaurant .####[([1], [0]), ([6], [4])]
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .####[([11], [10])]
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .####[([1], [7])]
Their apps are all delicious .####[([1], [4])]
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .####[([6], [9])]
But the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .####[([2], [6]), ([10], [12])]
– The food was not great & the waiters were rude .####[([2], [4, 5]), ([8], [10])]

Mediocre food####[([1], [0])]
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .####[([7], [6])]
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .####[([7], [10])]
We are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .####[([17], [16])]
Service was decent .####[([0], [2])]
Drinks were good .####[([0], [2])]
Excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3])]

I had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .####[([3, 4], [2]), ([6, 7], [2]), ([9], [2]), ([11], [2])]
The food was all good but it was way too mild .####[([1], [9, 10])]
The naan was some of the best I 've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .####[([1], [6]), ([15], [13])]
Even the chickpeas , which I normally find too dry , were good .####[([2], [12])]

Also , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , I believe is the traditional way ) !####[([6], [5])]
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .####[([6], [5]), ([10], [9])]

Seattle 's BEST Winelist####[([3], [2])]
The sommelier is fantastic , down-to-earth , & extremely knowlegable .####[([1], [9])]

The food is sinful .####[([1], [3])]
The staff was really friendly .####[([1], [4])]

Good eats .####[([1], [0])]
I have been to this place , folks and it is BAD .####[([5], [11])]
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half-way decent .####[([19], [23])]
I have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .####[([11, 12, 13], [19])]

It 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs ? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .####[([4], [3])]
Everything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .####[([8], [10])]
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .####[([1], [6])]
The sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !####[([1], [4])]
If you 're interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ...####[([17], [16]), ([20, 21], [19])]

- Mediocre Service / Quality####[([2], [1])]
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .####[([3], [5]), ([38], [36, 37])]
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####[([21], [20])]
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .####[([15], [18])]
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .####[([1], [37])]
The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####[([1], [2, 3, 4])]
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .####[([12], [11])]
Much more than just a great view !####[([6], [5])]
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray 's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .####[([11, 12, 13], [17, 18, 19])]
Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .####[([13, 14], [12])]
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !####[([15, 16], [2, 3])]
To start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .####[([8], [10])]
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .####[([22, 23, 24], [21]), ([33, 34], [32]), ([43, 44], [42]), ([56, 57], [55])]
For my entr & eacute ; e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####[([12, 13, 14, 15], [10])]
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .####[([1], [19])]
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [2]), ([10, 11, 12, 13], [9]), ([16, 17], [15])]
I had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .####[([10], [15])]
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####[([1], [5]), ([22, 23], [26])]
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####[([17], [16]), ([19], [16])]
Oh yeah ... the view was good , too .####[([4], [6])]
