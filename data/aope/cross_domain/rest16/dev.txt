I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )####[([10], [18]), ([12, 13], [18])]
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .####[([11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], [20])]

The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .####[([1, 2], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19])]
