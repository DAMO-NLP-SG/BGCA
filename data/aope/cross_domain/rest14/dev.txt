The pizza was really good .####[([1], [4])]
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely .####[([1], [4, 5])]
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .####[([8], [1])]
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .####[([0, 1, 2], [4]), ([6], [8, 9])]
Nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale Italian decor .####[([7, 8], [5, 6])]
I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .####[([5, 6], [3])]
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .####[([1], [3]), ([9], [11])]
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ?####[([4, 5], [13])]
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .####[([25], [23])]
The service was attentive .####[([1], [3])]
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire .####[([20], [24]), ([3, 4], [2])]

Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .####[([23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [19])]
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .####[([13], [12])]
Service was also very good .####[([0], [4])]
The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [10]), ([13], [15, 16])]
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .####[([22], [21]), ([25], [24]), ([28], [27]), ([32, 33], [31])]
On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .####[([22], [27, 28]), ([24], [27, 28]), ([34], [37])]
The makhani was OK -- the korma was bland .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [8])]
You are paying for the atmosphere , which is nice , but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge .####[([5], [9])]
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .####[([12], [11])]
While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service ) and lack of remorse .####[([4], [2]), ([13], [12]), ([15], [17, 18, 19]), ([22], [21])]
I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .####[([10], [16])]
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .####[([1], [4])]
Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .####[([9, 10], [12])]
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .####[([6], [5])]
Disappointing food , lousy service .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3])]
Try green curry with vegetables .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [0])]
Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .####[([5], [22])]
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .####[([6], [20])]
Over price , and small portions .####[([1], [0]), ([5], [4])]
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .####[([20], [23])]
While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous .####[([2], [4]), ([12], [14])]
The service was ok .####[([1], [3])]
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .####[([8], [7]), ([10], [7]), ([5], [4])]
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .####[([3], [11])]
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal####[([22], [21])]
Overall , I 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown .####[([13], [16])]
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .####[([1], [4]), ([7, 8], [11])]
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .####[([15], [12]), ([3], [3])]
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .####[([4], [2])]
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .####[([9], [14, 15])]
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .####[([1], [3, 4]), ([7], [12])]
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .####[([15, 16], [14]), ([19], [24, 25]), ([22], [11])]
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .####[([5, 6], [4]), ([2], [1])]
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .####[([8, 9], [7]), ([20, 21], [19])]
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .####[([8, 9], [6])]
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .####[([4], [3]), ([8], [7])]
I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .####[([14], [13]), ([19], [17, 18])]
Upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .####[([25], [24])]
I am happy i did the food was awesome .####[([6], [8])]
People are always friendly .####[([0], [3])]
The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no ambience at all .####[([1], [3, 4]), ([7], [9]), ([14], [13])]
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation-Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([20, 21], [18]), ([8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [7])]
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .####[([1], [6]), ([7, 8, 9], [6]), ([11], [14])]
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .####[([1], [8])]
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence !####[([5, 6], [8])]
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .####[([13], [16])]
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !####[([6], [5]), ([9], [13]), ([21, 22], [19, 20])]
Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .####[([10], [8]), ([12], [8]), ([16, 17], [14, 15]), ([21], [19, 20]), ([37], [39]), ([45], [44])]
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .####[([6, 7], [3, 4]), ([10, 11], [3, 4])]
It is also extremely well priced .####[([5], [4])]
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .####[([11], [10])]
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !####[([17], [16])]
A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa .####[([9], [6]), ([2], [1])]
The space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .####[([1], [6]), ([13, 14], [21])]
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .####[([1], [3]), ([9, 10, 11], [8]), ([14], [13])]
great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was INITIALLY fine .####[([1, 2], [0]), ([8], [7]), ([10], [13])]
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .####[([13], [12])]
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .####[([1], [11]), ([20], [25]), ([43, 44], [29])]
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .####[([1], [4])]
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !####[([0], [2]), ([4, 5], [8])]
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .####[([4, 5, 6], [9]), ([19, 20], [14])]
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .####[([12], [11]), ([1], [0])]
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .####[([10], [30]), ([4], [30])]
As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .####[([8], [10, 11, 12])]
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a 'special ' bagel experience .####[([1], [10])]
Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . .####[([6, 7], [10])]
I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going .####[([8], [7])]
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !####[([5], [6])]
Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .####[([18], [15])]
Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .####[([8, 9, 10], [7])]
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .####[([14], [12, 13])]
Two words : Free wine .####[([4], [3])]
I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .####[([5, 6], [4])]
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .####[([2], [1])]
The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .####[([1, 2, 3], [18, 19])]
My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .####[([7], [9])]
No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .####[([13], [12])]
While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .####[([25], [13]), ([28], [13])]
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .####[([11], [23])]
Great atmoshere and worth every bit .####[([1], [0])]
but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .####[([6], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14])]
While the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything I 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty .####[([2], [6])]
Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3])]
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .####[([1], [3])]
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .####[([1], [3]), ([11], [10])]
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .####[([4], [3])]
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .####[([8], [17])]
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .####[([4, 5], [9, 10, 11, 12])]
Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .####[([5], [4])]
The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly .####[([12], [13])]
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .####[([10], [9])]
So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .####[([11], [14])]
Orsay , is a very pleasant throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .####[([10, 11], [9]), ([15], [9])]
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .####[([16, 17, 18], [14, 15])]
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .####[([7], [3])]
The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !####[([1, 2], [4]), ([8], [13])]
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .####[([5, 6], [8])]
I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .####[([13], [15])]
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .####[([6], [5]), ([12], [11]), ([18], [17])]
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's .####[([19, 20], [16])]
Ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food .####[([6, 7], [4, 5])]
As I made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste .####[([13], [12])]
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there .####[([1], [2])]
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .####[([5], [4])]
I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .####[([4, 5], [2]), ([8, 9], [2])]
The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .####[([1], [3]), ([7], [9])]
The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .####[([1], [2]), ([4], [7]), ([12, 13], [15]), ([20, 21, 22], [23, 24]), ([24], [23])]
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .####[([5], [9]), ([21], [23]), ([36, 37], [33]), ([39], [33]), ([26], [28, 29])]
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .####[([2, 3], [1])]
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 3.00 in NYC .####[([14], [11]), ([17], [11])]
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .####[([5], [23]), ([17], [23])]
Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !####[([20], [25])]
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .####[([7], [8, 9, 10, 11])]
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .####[([5], [2, 3])]
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !####[([18], [20])]
They 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny .####[([8], [3])]
Jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx .####[([8], [6])]
It 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .####[([9], [15])]
The food is authentic Italian - delicious !####[([1], [6])]
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .####[([14], [13])]
So if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at Montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe .####[([8], [7]), ([16, 17], [7])]
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .####[([1], [3])]
This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 !####[([8], [2])]
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it .####[([11, 12, 13], [10])]
The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well .####[([1, 2], [4])]
A++ The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .####[([2], [4]), ([10], [6])]
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .####[([1], [4])]
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .####[([3, 4], [2]), ([7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [7]), ([19, 20, 21, 22, 23], [18]), ([36, 37], [35])]
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !####[([1, 2, 3], [16]), ([10, 11], [9])]
