My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt flavor .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([12], [11])]
The main draw of this place is the price .####[([8], [2])]
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .####[([1], [4, 5]), ([10], [14, 15, 16])]
Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , pizza etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !####[([7], [5]), ([9], [5]), ([11], [5]), ([16, 17], [19, 20, 21, 22])]
the homemade Guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .####[([1, 2], [11]), ([6], [5]), ([12], [11])]
The sushi is reasonably priced and fresh .####[([1], [6]), ([4], [3])]
Save room for deserts - they 're to die for .####[([3], [8, 9])]
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting .####[([1, 2, 3], [7]), ([13], [12])]
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .####[([1], [5]), ([8], [12])]
The ambiance was pretty cool , but not worth the hassle .####[([1], [7, 8, 9, 10])]
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I 've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza 's .####[([26, 27], [24, 25])]
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .####[([1], [4]), ([9], [12, 13])]
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit .####[([17], [16]), ([23], [22])]
Chef Vincenzo , always there if you need him , is a real talent and a real Roman .####[([0], [13])]

In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste .####[([23], [22]), ([9], [8])]

They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .####[([11], [10])]
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .####[([3], [2]), ([10], [12, 13, 14]), ([17], [21])]
the icing MADE this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .####[([4], [16])]
Finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff .####[([17], [16]), ([13], [12])]
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff -- even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .####[([15, 16], [12])]

It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza ( at least I do n't think they ever made it before this year ) ... but it was worth the wait .####[([11], [31, 32, 33])]
I asked for a simple medium rare steak .####[([7], [6])]
Generously garnished , organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish , but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads -- layered with beets , goat cheese and walnuts -- are equally scrumptious .####[([3, 4, 5], [9]), ([10], [9]), ([14, 15, 16, 17], [32, 33]), ([19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], [32, 33])]
Probably my worst dining experience in new york , and I 'm a former waiter so I know what I 'm talking about .####[([3, 4], [2])]
Result ( red velvet ) : Great texture , soft and velvety , nice hint of cocoa .####[([7], [11]), ([14, 15, 16], [13])]
Their twist on pizza is healthy , but full of flavor .####[([10], [8]), ([1, 2, 3], [5])]
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies ( although everyone is polite and no one is pushing ) is a slight turn off .####[([3], [1])]
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people .####[([30], [29]), ([33, 34], [29])]
Unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it 's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure .####[([15], [14])]
The food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .####[([1], [10])]
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT .####[([19], [22])]

I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like .####[([6], [10])]
Somewhat disappointing wine list ( only new vintages .####[([2, 3], [1])]
If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A $ $ this is the place to be ! !####[([7], [5, 6]), ([6], [5])]
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !####[([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [6]), ([12, 13], [10, 11])]
Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce -- generous portions .####[([3], [0]), ([8], [5, 6, 7]), ([11], [10])]
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .####[([0], [2]), ([6], [8])]
To the owners ; good job guys , this place is a keeper !####[([2], [4])]
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly .####[([2], [7])]
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .####[([2], [4, 5, 6])]

The service was great , and they have a whole great deal for birthdays .####[([1], [3])]
The staff is 100 % Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets .####[([8], [11])]
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I 've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar .####[([6, 7], [2])]

The service was dreadfully slow ( the place was only half full ) and a smile would have been nice ...####[([1], [3, 4])]

Disappointingly , their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu .####[([4], [3]), ([10, 11], [0])]
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .####[([13], [12])]
The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .####[([1, 2], [5])]
After waiting for almost an hour , the waiter brusquely told us he 'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order .####[([8], [9])]
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere .####[([22], [20]), ([24], [20])]
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices .####[([14], [19]), ([23], [22]), ([20], [19])]
Give it a try , menu is typical French but varied .####[([5], [10])]
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice .####[([10], [8])]
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they ca n't compete with Temple 's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food .####[([36], [34, 35]), ([23], [22])]
Overall , this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent .####[([6], [5]), ([18], [20])]
Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .####[([0], [2]), ([8], [6])]
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito ( or tacos ) , margarita , and dessert .####[([8], [7]), ([11], [7])]
The space is traditional in feel .####[([1], [3])]
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .####[([1], [3]), ([9], [13]), ([16], [26])]
Good service , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3]), ([7], [6]), ([13], [10])]
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast .####[([6, 7, 8], [10]), ([2, 3], [10])]
I have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant .####[([14], [16]), ([19], [20])]
The music was fascinating , but left room for conversation , and the bartender made superb drinks .####[([1], [3]), ([13], [15]), ([16], [15])]
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $ 5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $ 2 and you 're set for the night !####[([14, 15], [13])]
Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .####[([1], [0]), ([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0]), ([11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [20]), ([26, 27], [20])]
Dishes denoted as `` Roy 's Classics '' ( marked on the menu with asterisks ) are tried-and-true recipes , such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi , or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs .####[([0], [17]), ([3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [17]), ([18], [17]), ([22, 23, 24], [17]), ([28, 29, 30, 31, 32], [28])]
The cold sesame noodles , which are a freebie when you order $ 10+ , are delectable .####[([1, 2, 3], [16])]
I came to fresh expecting a great meal , and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we could n't enjoy eating .####[([16], [14, 15])]
The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $ 8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $ 2.99/lb at the store .####[([11, 12, 13, 14], [10])]
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner , but nothing amazing .####[([16], [15])]
Best Chinese on the Upper East , prompt delivery , good value .####[([8], [7]), ([11], [10])]
Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good .####[([3], [13])]
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess .####[([19], [18])]
It 's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea .####[([13], [12])]
Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .####[([4], [5]), ([9], [19])]
It has good music , nice tapas , an interesting selection of wines ( primarily Spanish ) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele .####[([3], [2]), ([6], [5]), ([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], [9]), ([22], [20])]
The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , chicken and shrimp dishs .####[([1], [3]), ([8], [6]), ([10, 11, 12], [6]), ([14], [6]), ([16, 17], [6])]

This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food .####[([5], [4]), ([15], [14])]
The appetizers are ok , but the service is slow .####[([1], [3]), ([7], [9])]
the food - not worth the price .####[([1], [3, 4]), ([6], [3, 4])]
What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back ( which she did politely , by the way ) .####[([14], [13])]
The prices are not terrible .####[([1], [3, 4])]
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal .####[([1, 2, 3], [19]), ([8, 9, 10, 11], [7])]
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .####[([0], [2]), ([7], [2]), ([9], [12]), ([15, 16], [12])]

Although somewhat loud , the noise was minimally intrusive .####[([5], [7, 8])]
It 's a basic pizza joint , not much to look at , but the pizza is what I go for .####[([15], [19, 20])]
Tables are close , so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons .####[([0], [2])]
Not too much so , but enough that there 's a great scene .####[([12], [11])]
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and spices .####[([7, 8], [6]), ([16], [13]), ([18], [13]), ([21], [13]), ([23], [13])]
At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close .####[([9], [11, 12])]
The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz ?####[([1], [3, 4])]
Menus feature seasonal picks , like sweet corn-foie gras brulee .####[([0], [2])]
Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .####[([9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [8]), ([25, 26, 27], [24])]

The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .####[([1, 2, 3], [11]), ([8], [11])]

His food is excellent ( and not expensive by NYC standards- no entrees over $ 30 , most appetizers $ 12 to 14 ) .####[([1], [3]), ([18], [6, 7])]
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me .####[([1], [5])]
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of fresh veggies .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([10, 11], [8])]
do n't get me wrong - sushi was good , just not fantastic .####[([6], [11, 12])]

We recently spent New Year 's Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu .####[([19], [14]), ([22, 23], [14])]
Highly recommended ... As stated , I have n't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place ; also , the bar looks nice .####[([27], [26]), ([32], [34])]
The ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic .####[([1], [12])]
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers ( nice non-sushi selection ) .####[([3, 4], [6, 7, 8]), ([18, 19], [17]), ([15], [14])]

I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade .####[([25, 26], [24]), ([28, 29], [24]), ([22], [20])]
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .####[([1], [0]), ([15], [14]), ([18, 19], [17])]
Very nice touch that very much fits the place .####[([8], [1])]
However , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .####[([18, 19], [16]), ([10], [7])]
The comments about fried foods is correct ( below ) but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads ( avocado shrimp ) were quite good .####[([13], [30]), ([17, 18], [30]), ([23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [30])]
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?####[([1], [0])]
The sauce is excellent ( very fresh ) with dabs of real mozzarella .####[([1], [6])]
Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .####[([6], [8]), ([14], [23]), ([26], [23])]
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .####[([1], [5])]
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great .####[([0], [7])]
A small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .####[([12], [11]), ([3, 4, 5], [1])]
And all the { female } servers are cute too , which is always nice .####[([3, 4, 5, 6], [14])]
The best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly Hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets .####[([2], [1])]
for an appetizer , their calamari is a winner .####[([2], [8]), ([5], [8])]
The room is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink .####[([1], [4]), ([6, 7], [4]), ([10, 11], [12])]
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .####[([3, 4], [5])]
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .####[([32], [31])]
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [6]), ([9, 10, 11], [9])]
several times and put up with the waiters ' bad manners , knowing that their job is n't easy .####[([7], [9])]
The service is great ( maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention ) , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good ...####[([1], [3]), ([18], [20]), ([23], [27])]
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for .####[([4, 5], [9, 10])]
While the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best I have ever had !####[([2], [6]), ([11, 12], [15])]
The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good .####[([1], [10, 11, 12]), ([18], [28]), ([24], [28])]
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .####[([1], [6, 7]), ([7], [6])]
The new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites ( but they raised the prices ) , the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : No , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .####[([25], [23]), ([29], [31]), ([1, 2], [6])]
It ' only open for lunch but the food is so good !####[([8], [11])]

i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices .####[([10], [12])]
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter .####[([20], [19])]
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .####[([2], [5])]
Its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .####[([29], [32]), ([6], [1])]
Anyway , the owner was fake .####[([3], [5])]
Owner is pleasant and entertaining .####[([0], [4])]
Creamy appetizers -- taramasalata , eggplant salad , and Greek yogurt ( with cuccumber , dill , and garlic ) taste excellent when on warm pitas .####[([0, 1], [21]), ([24, 25], [24]), ([3], [0]), ([5, 6], [21]), ([9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [21])]
