It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .####[([3], [10]), ([5], [10])]
Besides , when you have bad service , that 's less money you have to tip .####[([6], [5]), ([11], [10]), ([15], [5])]
The staff offers impeccable service .####[([1], [3]), ([4], [3])]
The service was typical short-order , dinner type .####[([1], [3])]
Acceptable prices .####[([1], [0])]
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [11])]
So all I 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I 've ever been to .####[([15, 16], [14])]
Delivery service is great too .####[([0, 1], [3])]
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12- $ 15 per meal , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !####[([8], [1]), ([28], [20, 21, 22, 23, 24])]
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .####[([2], [0]), ([21], [19, 20]), ([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [19])]
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [7, 8, 9, 10])]
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .####[([2, 3], [8, 9, 10]), ([27], [24, 25]), ([14, 15], [13])]
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .####[([8], [7])]
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .####[([7], [9])]
at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous .####[([22], [29])]
Good food .####[([1], [0]), ([1], [0])]
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .####[([3], [2]), ([6], [5])]
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .####[([14], [13]), ([22], [25])]
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating .####[([11], [23])]
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .####[([3], [8]), ([5], [8]), ([7], [8])]
I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .####[([7], [1])]
Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small .####[([11], [13, 14])]
I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .####[([6], [5])]
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly .####[([9], [10])]
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .####[([5, 6], [9])]
The sauces used are also not that exciting .####[([1], [5, 6, 7])]
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food .####[([16, 17], [15])]
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .####[([12], [11])]
You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .####[([8], [7]), ([17], [14]), ([21], [20])]
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .####[([4], [6, 7])]
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .####[([6], [10])]
We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .####[([9], [11]), ([18], [16])]
We had great desserts ( including the best cannoli I 've ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .####[([3], [2]), ([8], [7])]
The service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .####[([1], [11])]
Incredible food at a very agreeable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .####[([1], [0]), ([6], [5])]

Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !####[([0], [5]), ([17], [20, 21]), ([2, 3], [5])]
Both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .####[([5], [7])]
Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .####[([5, 6], [1]), ([9, 10], [1]), ([15, 16, 17], [14]), ([2], [1])]
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .####[([6], [11])]
Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .####[([13], [11]), ([22, 23], [21])]
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .####[([17, 18], [2]), ([9], [2])]
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .####[([3], [4, 5, 6, 7]), ([10], [13]), ([14], [13])]
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .####[([1], [3, 4]), ([7], [11])]
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe .####[([1], [3]), ([9, 10], [8])]
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .####[([1], [3]), ([9, 10, 11], [5])]
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .####[([18], [16])]
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .####[([14, 15], [13]), ([17], [13])]
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .####[([18], [15])]

The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !####[([1], [3]), ([6], [11])]
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .####[([6, 7, 8], [5])]
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .####[([12, 13], [18])]
Good bagels and good cream cheese .####[([1], [3]), ([4, 5], [3])]
Our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic .####[([2], [1])]
And the food was fantastic .####[([2], [4])]
Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .####[([3], [12])]
The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .####[([1], [3])]
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####[([4], [3]), ([7], [6]), ([11], [10])]
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .####[([1], [4]), ([8], [10]), ([19], [22])]
Stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .####[([7], [4, 5, 6])]
Great pizza for lunch place .####[([1], [0])]
The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .####[([13], [20]), ([1], [5])]
it 's a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .####[([9, 10], [8])]
The food was very expensive ( we spent $ 160 for lunch for two ) but extremely tasty .####[([1], [17])]
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !####[([2], [4])]
The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .####[([1], [4]), ([7], [10]), ([16, 17], [15])]
We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .####[([17], [16])]
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delicious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .####[([1, 2], [7]), ([9, 10], [8]), ([13, 14], [17])]
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .####[([11], [15]), ([6], [15]), ([9], [15])]
The food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings I 've had .####[([1], [10]), ([13, 14], [10])]
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous .####[([8, 9], [29]), ([14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [29]), ([20, 21], [29]), ([23, 24], [29])]
The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta .####[([1, 2], [4])]
And the prices were way to high for what you get .####[([2], [6])]
Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine .####[([14], [13]), ([16], [13]), ([10], [9])]
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([14, 15], [13])]
The food was great .####[([1], [3])]
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .####[([1], [4, 5, 6]), ([9], [13]), ([16, 17], [13]), ([20, 21, 22, 23], [13])]
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .####[([1], [3])]
The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .####[([1, 2], [22]), ([13], [11, 12])]
A wonderful place !####[([2], [1])]
Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .####[([0], [4])]
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .####[([12], [2])]
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####[([5], [9, 10])]
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .####[([1], [3]), ([7, 8], [6])]
There was no ambiance .####[([3], [2])]
For the quality of food , a little too expensive .####[([2, 3, 4], [9])]
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...####[([3], [2]), ([18, 19, 20], [17])]
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .####[([5, 6], [15]), ([18], [21])]
Late nite omelletes are not good here , there is no variety !####[([2], [4, 5])]
Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .####[([4], [3]), ([21], [20]), ([11], [10]), ([14], [13])]
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretentious setting .####[([1], [0]), ([5], [3]), ([8], [7]), ([12], [11])]
Always a nice crowd , but never loud .####[([3], [6, 7])]
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .####[([20], [19])]
Great sushi experience .####[([1], [0])]
I LOVED THE SHOWS .####[([3], [1])]
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !####[([8], [2]), ([10], [2])]
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions .####[([1], [5])]
Their sushi , Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented .####[([1], [10, 11]), ([3], [10, 11]), ([6], [10, 11])]
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( stacks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .####[([2], [1]), ([7], [6]), ([15], [12]), ([35], [31])]
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available .####[([1], [2, 3]), ([6, 7], [10])]
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !####[([11], [10])]
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .####[([1], [11])]
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .####[([9, 10], [14])]
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .####[([4], [7]), ([12, 13], [15])]
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC .####[([1], [4, 5]), ([5], [4])]
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing .####[([10], [16])]
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .####[([14, 15, 16], [13])]
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .####[([7], [3]), ([12], [18, 19]), ([9], [3])]
I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .####[([8], [12])]
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([10], [12])]
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction####[([0, 1], [5, 6])]
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .####[([9], [8]), ([17], [19]), ([1], [3])]
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .####[([1], [3]), ([6, 7, 8], [13])]
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !####[([6, 7], [15]), ([10], [15])]
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth it superb food .####[([1], [21, 22]), ([25], [24]), ([3, 4], [21, 22])]
The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .####[([1], [7]), ([20], [19]), ([11, 12, 13], [15])]
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .####[([9, 10], [11])]
The lox is always fresh too .####[([1], [4])]
The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .####[([3], [7])]
The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .####[([1, 2], [4])]
First of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .####[([5], [7, 8])]
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them .####[([4, 5], [11])]
Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .####[([3], [2]), ([5, 6, 7, 8], [2]), ([10, 11, 12], [2])]
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .####[([0], [2]), ([4, 5], [6]), ([8], [9])]
I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .####[([4, 5], [2])]
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .####[([3], [2])]
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !####[([1, 2], [14])]
It 's just O.K . pizza .####[([5], [3, 4])]
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .####[([1], [5]), ([8], [11]), ([17, 18], [16])]
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .####[([21], [18])]
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .####[([1], [5])]
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !####[([3], [1]), ([5, 6], [1]), ([9, 10, 11], [14]), ([18], [14])]
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .####[([9], [2]), ([12], [2]), ([15], [14])]
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .####[([11], [2]), ([15], [2])]
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .####[([13], [15]), ([21], [19, 20])]
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .####[([7], [9])]
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .####[([12], [11])]
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .####[([3], [6]), ([10, 11], [6])]
My turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .####[([1, 2], [4, 5]), ([11], [14])]
And the bill was outrageous .####[([2], [4])]
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .####[([2], [4]), ([12], [11])]
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .####[([1], [4])]
The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .####[([1], [4, 5])]
I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .####[([18], [13])]
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like ' bar ' or ' pub ' .####[([19], [13]), ([23], [13])]
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty .####[([7, 8], [17]), ([14], [13])]
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .####[([0], [7, 8])]
Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .####[([15], [17])]
The flavors robust and subtle .####[([1], [4])]
Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .####[([10, 11, 12], [8]), ([14, 15, 16], [8]), ([18, 19], [8]), ([29, 30], [8]), ([3, 4], [8]), ([21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [8])]
but the service was a bit slow .####[([2], [6])]
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) .####[([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [2]), ([13], [15])]
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .####[([10, 11, 12], [9])]
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .####[([3], [13])]
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .####[([1], [7])]
The food is amazing ! ! ! !####[([1], [3])]
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .####[([3, 4], [9]), ([24], [9]), ([13], [9])]
All conveniently delivered right to the door .####[([2], [1])]
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .####[([8], [7]), ([11], [10])]
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .####[([8], [13])]
The food was bland oily .####[([1], [3, 4])]
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .####[([5], [8])]
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .####[([1], [4])]
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .####[([9], [12])]
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .####[([0], [2, 3, 4, 5])]
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !####[([5, 6], [11])]
But the coconut rice was good .####[([2, 3], [5])]
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .####[([23], [22])]
The food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .####[([1], [5]), ([9], [8])]
Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared .####[([0], [4]), ([6, 7], [9]), ([15], [19]), ([12], [11])]
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .####[([18], [16])]
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .####[([25], [24])]
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food .####[([2], [1])]
The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .####[([2], [5])]
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .####[([1, 2, 3], [11]), ([17], [16])]
Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .####[([3], [5])]
Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good .####[([8], [10, 11]), ([15], [19]), ([1], [0])]
The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .####[([4], [3]), ([9], [8])]

Made my dining experience uncomfortable .####[([2, 3], [4])]
The burger was great , also .####[([1], [3])]
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !####[([1, 2, 3], [8])]
Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([7], [6]), ([11], [10])]
The Italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the UES ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...####[([1, 2], [11]), ([19], [45])]
The dim sum here is only so-so .####[([1, 2], [6])]
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .####[([0], [3]), ([7, 8], [11]), ([4], [3]), ([19], [16])]

The best burger I have had in the Village .####[([2], [1])]
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .####[([1, 2, 3], [9, 10])]

For the location , the prices are very reasonable .####[([5], [8]), ([2], [8])]

Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .####[([4], [3]), ([19, 20], [13, 14])]
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .####[([14], [12]), ([2], [4, 5, 6])]
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .####[([14], [13])]
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .####[([0, 1, 2], [4]), ([7], [10])]
They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .####[([5], [4]), ([11], [7]), ([16], [14])]
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one .####[([4], [10])]
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [8])]
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .####[([19], [8])]
Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .####[([13], [7])]

The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .####[([1], [4]), ([7], [11, 12, 13])]
great eats , good times .####[([1], [0])]
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .####[([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [8])]
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .####[([23], [22])]
Delicious crab cakes too .####[([1, 2], [0])]
Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' perks ' were great .####[([4], [5]), ([11], [14])]
However , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .####[([6], [5]), ([10], [9]), ([16], [12, 13, 14])]
The one vegetarian entree ( Abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .####[([2, 3], [17]), ([5, 6, 7], [17]), ([23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], [25])]

IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .####[([11], [3])]
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .####[([12], [11]), ([5, 6, 7, 8], [2])]
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .####[([11], [3])]
The wine list is excellent .####[([1, 2], [4])]
The drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .####[([1], [4, 5]), ([7, 8], [10, 11]), ([11], [10])]
For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !####[([6], [5]), ([9], [8])]
They could n't even make a salad that was appealing .####[([6], [9])]
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .####[([1, 2], [8, 9, 10])]
Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) .####[([11, 12, 13], [17]), ([2], [0, 1])]
Great staff .####[([1], [0])]
Service is fast and friendly .####[([0], [4])]
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .####[([16, 17], [15])]
Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .####[([3], [6]), ([10, 11], [9])]

This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .####[([17], [15]), ([20], [15])]

This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .####[([10], [9])]

big and soft as well as good lunch food .####[([7, 8], [6])]
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .####[([0], [9]), ([2], [9])]
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !####[([3], [5]), ([8], [11])]
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .####[([3], [6]), ([9, 10], [13])]
While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .####[([10], [12])]
Awesome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [0])]
Priced at upper intermediate range .####[([0], [2, 3])]
Decent wine selection too .####[([1, 2], [0])]
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .####[([1], [18, 19, 20])]
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .####[([7], [5])]
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .####[([1], [3]), ([8, 9], [6])]
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [2]), ([14], [16, 17])]
Okay service .####[([1], [0])]
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .####[([2, 3, 4], [6])]
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !####[([14], [21])]
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective !####[([0], [13, 14])]
While the food was excellent , it was n't cheap ( though not extremely expensive either ) .####[([2], [4])]
Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .####[([20], [19]), ([25], [23, 24])]
The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .####[([1], [9]), ([17], [14]), ([12], [14])]
The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .####[([1], [5]), ([7], [9, 10])]
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .####[([4], [3]), ([6], [7]), ([10], [9])]
Good luck getting a table .####[([2, 3, 4], [0, 1])]
Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) .####[([0], [2]), ([6], [9])]
The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .####[([1], [4]), ([7], [8]), ([12], [13])]
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .####[([6], [4, 5]), ([9], [8])]
Beef noodle soup is good as well .####[([0, 1, 2], [4])]
Waiters are slow but sweet .####[([0], [4])]
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .####[([1], [4])]
Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .####[([14], [9])]
The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually .####[([1], [6])]
The service is ok but could be better .####[([1], [5, 6, 7])]
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .####[([17], [11]), ([21], [20])]
I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out .####[([5, 6, 7], [11])]
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .####[([4, 5], [10])]
Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .####[([1], [2, 3])]
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .####[([11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], [20]), ([8], [20])]
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .####[([13], [7]), ([2, 3], [7])]
I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !####[([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [14])]
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff .####[([6], [4])]
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been subpar the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating ( if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud ) .####[([1], [7, 8]), ([11, 12], [16]), ([18], [24]), ([31], [45])]
The sushi is also great !####[([1], [4])]
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .####[([5], [4]), ([16], [15])]
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )####[([21], [20])]
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .####[([1], [6]), ([15], [14])]
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .####[([6], [0])]
It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .####[([12], [11]), ([14], [11])]
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .####[([10], [12])]
The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce .####[([1, 2], [5]), ([22, 23, 24, 25], [21])]
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .####[([8], [14]), ([29], [28]), ([15], [14]), ([44], [43])]
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .####[([6], [10])]
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .####[([6], [2, 3])]
night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .####[([19], [22])]
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !####[([2], [6]), ([4], [6]), ([9], [12]), ([15], [17])]
Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY .####[([13], [12])]
The prices are wonderfully low .####[([1], [3, 4])]
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .####[([5], [4])]
Unique apppetizers .####[([1], [0])]
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .####[([13, 14, 15], [25])]
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .####[([1], [8, 9]), ([12], [13])]
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .####[([1], [5])]
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .####[([1, 2, 3], [8])]
The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .####[([1], [5])]
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .####[([6], [8]), ([21], [20]), ([16], [15])]
I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .####[([6], [13])]
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .####[([9, 10], [8]), ([19], [18])]
Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bijin ) , but pricey .####[([0, 1], [11]), ([6, 7], [5])]
If you love seafood , you would love this place !####[([3], [2]), ([9], [7])]
My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .####[([17], [15])]
There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .####[([6], [3])]
Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices .####[([15, 16], [12])]
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .####[([10], [9]), ([14, 15, 16], [12])]
The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .####[([1], [3]), ([9], [35])]
After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I 've found little toninos .####[([4], [3])]
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [13])]
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .####[([31], [30])]
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .####[([8], [7])]
Their sake martini is wonderful .####[([1, 2], [4])]
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [7])]
The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .####[([1], [10])]
The chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .####[([0, 1, 2, 3], [5]), ([8], [11]), ([15], [18])]
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !####[([5], [4])]
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .####[([18], [17])]
Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .####[([0], [2])]
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .####[([3], [14]), ([7], [14])]
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .####[([6], [3]), ([13], [12])]
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .####[([1, 2], [8]), ([16, 17], [15]), ([34], [32, 33])]
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area .####[([9], [11])]
The Thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 .####[([1], [6])]
We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .####[([12], [10]), ([14], [10])]
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !####[([4], [9])]
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .####[([7, 8], [3]), ([11, 12, 13], [16])]
The pizza was great .####[([1], [3])]
Not worth the prices .####[([3], [1])]
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .####[([3], [2]), ([8], [10, 11])]
The ' kamasutra ' and ' bombay cosmopolitan ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .####[([2], [10]), ([6, 7], [10])]
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .####[([5], [16]), ([19], [21]), ([33, 34], [26])]
It 's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner .####[([10], [9])]
No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .####[([1, 2], [0]), ([5], [4]), ([14], [13])]
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .####[([0, 1], [4])]
Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .####[([2, 3, 4], [11]), ([7, 8, 9], [11])]
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .####[([15], [14])]
Great food ( spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry ) , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .####[([1], [0]), ([3, 4, 5, 6], [0]), ([17], [16]), ([23], [22]), ([8, 9], [13])]
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops .####[([7], [1])]
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .####[([7], [8]), ([1, 2], [4]), ([10], [8])]
The dim sum however was very good .####[([1, 2], [6])]
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .####[([1], [3]), ([15], [17]), ([21], [24, 25])]
Food was okay , nothing great .####[([0], [4, 5])]
Taxan delicious !####[([0], [1])]
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .####[([6], [5]), ([8], [5]), ([13], [11, 12])]
Food was OK - fish was cooked well .####[([0], [2]), ([4], [6, 7])]
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .####[([14], [18]), ([5], [8])]
The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters .####[([1], [10])]
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .####[([1], [9])]
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .####[([16], [15])]
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .####[([8], [4])]
Pizza here is consistently good .####[([0], [4])]
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !####[([4], [9])]
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .####[([3], [13])]
Simple comfort food and what hot and large portions .####[([1, 2], [1]), ([8], [7])]
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .####[([1], [4]), ([7], [6]), ([14], [12])]
First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her ( odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong .####[([4], [7])]
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .####[([10], [9])]
The place was quiet and delightful .####[([1], [5])]
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !####[([1, 2, 3], [0]), ([5, 6, 7], [0])]
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .####[([1], [6, 7])]
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .####[([23], [28])]
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .####[([1], [5]), ([8], [10])]
This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .####[([7], [6])]
Service was slow , but the people were friendly .####[([0], [2]), ([6], [8])]
( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .####[([20], [15])]
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .####[([33], [9]), ([16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [9]), ([22, 23], [9]), ([25, 26], [9]), ([5], [3]), ([30], [9]), ([35], [9]), ([39, 40], [9])]
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .####[([11], [13])]
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .####[([3, 4], [1]), ([14], [1]), ([6, 7, 8, 9], [1])]
service was efficient courteous .####[([0], [3])]
It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .####[([9], [12])]
The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [3])]
Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .####[([1], [5])]
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .####[([16], [15]), ([21], [19, 20]), ([40], [39]), ([30], [27, 28]), ([32, 33], [27, 28])]
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impeccable , and the food magnificant .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [7]), ([11], [12])]
Service was quick .####[([0], [2])]
Food - awesome .####[([0], [2])]
It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .####[([9, 10], [3])]
We started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner .####[([3], [8]), ([5], [8])]
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .####[([18], [22])]
I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .####[([4], [3]), ([15], [14])]
The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .####[([1], [4]), ([9, 10], [17])]
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .####[([1, 2], [9, 10]), ([4], [9, 10])]
Prices are in line .####[([0], [2, 3])]
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .####[([9], [11])]
But , nothing stands out about the cooking .####[([7], [2, 3, 4])]
Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .####[([12], [9]), ([15], [9])]
As for the bar , this is another bad idea .####[([3], [8])]
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .####[([7], [5]), ([10, 11, 12], [5])]
$ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality -- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to .####[([5], [4]), ([28, 29], [27]), ([10], [9])]
The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .####[([1, 2], [3, 4]), ([7], [9]), ([4], [3])]
They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .####[([8], [6]), ([26], [29, 30]), ([15], [10, 11]), ([12], [10, 11]), ([35], [29, 30]), ([18], [10, 11])]
at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven .####[([7], [11])]
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .####[([8], [15])]
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .####[([1], [5]), ([3], [5])]
The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .####[([1, 2], [10]), ([6], [5])]
And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .####[([9], [8]), ([4, 5], [8])]
The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !####[([1], [11]), ([9], [11]), ([14], [11])]
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) .####[([1], [3]), ([16, 17], [22])]
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .####[([4], [1])]
I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .####[([3, 4], [11]), ([21, 22], [27]), ([6], [11])]
At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .####[([9, 10, 11], [8])]
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !####[([3], [1]), ([5], [1]), ([8], [1])]
We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .####[([17], [16])]
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .####[([4, 5, 6, 7], [1]), ([9, 10], [1])]
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !####[([1], [4]), ([9], [11])]
I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .####[([6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [5])]
Great food , great prices , great service .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3]), ([7], [6])]
The staff is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excellent recomendations .####[([1], [16])]
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .####[([11], [14]), ([17], [19])]
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat ! ! !####[([0], [2]), ([4], [7]), ([14], [15, 16, 17, 18])]
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .####[([9], [10, 11, 12, 13])]
I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow .####[([8], [7])]
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .####[([1, 2], [4])]
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .####[([17], [15])]

Great service , great food .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3])]
I would highly recommend requesting a table by the window .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [3])]
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .####[([14], [16])]
We had the most wonderful waitress .####[([5], [4])]
Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !####[([5], [11])]
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .####[([0], [2, 3]), ([5], [6])]
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .####[([6], [5])]
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .####[([14], [16]), ([22], [20]), ([8], [4])]
I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .####[([10], [9])]
Very affordable and excellent ambient !####[([4], [3])]
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .####[([5, 6, 7, 8], [15])]
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week 's notice .####[([7], [3])]
The food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next .####[([1], [15]), ([7], [5]), ([18], [20])]

This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .####[([6, 7], [5])]

I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time .####[([10], [14])]
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .####[([3], [5, 6]), ([10], [14]), ([6], [5])]
Good , fast service .####[([3], [2])]
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .####[([1], [4]), ([6], [7])]
I had the best ravioli ever .####[([4], [3])]
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .####[([3, 4], [0]), ([1], [0])]
Great selection of wine , and seafood .####[([1, 2, 3], [0]), ([6], [0])]
Also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't .####[([7], [11])]
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .####[([1, 2], [9])]
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .####[([11], [8])]
Service is average .####[([0], [2])]
Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .####[([4], [3]), ([10], [9])]
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .####[([7], [1]), ([19, 20], [24, 25])]
The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .####[([5, 6], [15])]
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .####[([10], [4]), ([12], [4]), ([14, 15], [4]), ([22, 23], [21]), ([5, 6, 7], [4])]
The sushi was awful !####[([1], [3])]

my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !####[([18], [20])]
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .####[([16], [18]), ([1], [12])]
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .####[([9, 10], [7]), ([12], [7]), ([14], [18])]
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .####[([1], [3]), ([14], [17])]
The food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .####[([1], [4]), ([12], [8, 9, 10, 11])]
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ... .####[([1], [7]), ([4], [7])]
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant .####[([3], [1])]
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .####[([1], [2, 3, 4])]
The design and atmosphere is just as good .####[([1], [7]), ([3], [7])]
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .####[([15], [14]), ([5], [1])]
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .####[([14], [13])]
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I ca n't wait !####[([12], [11]), ([15, 16], [14])]
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .####[([7, 8], [6]), ([13], [15])]
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and undistinguished .####[([2], [10])]
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .####[([2], [5])]
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .####[([4], [10])]
We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .####[([3, 4], [8, 9]), ([10], [8, 9]), ([16, 17], [8, 9])]
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .####[([16], [12]), ([20], [19])]
Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !####[([6, 7], [9])]
Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) .####[([2], [4])]
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .####[([6, 7], [14])]
Service was on par but not wonderful .####[([0], [5, 6])]
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad .####[([7, 8], [4])]
Service was good and food is wonderful .####[([0], [2]), ([4], [6])]
The cuisine from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .####[([1], [14])]
The food was pretty traditional but it was hot and good with large portions .####[([1], [10]), ([13], [12])]
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .####[([1], [3]), ([5], [7, 8]), ([12], [15]), ([20, 21], [15]), ([23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [15])]
Why do people rave about the ambience .####[([6], [3])]
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .####[([12], [11])]
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables .####[([0, 1, 2], [4]), ([6], [8]), ([12], [8]), ([14], [8]), ([16], [8]), ([18], [8]), ([20], [8])]
Service -- friendly and attentive .####[([0], [4])]
From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .####[([1, 2], [7]), ([5], [7]), ([12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [11]), ([24], [21])]
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .####[([7, 8], [6])]
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .####[([23], [52])]
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !####[([5, 6], [9])]
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...####[([6], [8])]
I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .####[([31], [30])]
The buffet had a nice selection .####[([1], [4]), ([5], [4])]
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken , then this is NOT your place .####[([6, 7, 8], [2])]
The wine list is extensive and impressive .####[([1, 2], [6])]
The best pad thai i 've ever had .####[([2, 3], [1])]
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .####[([9], [8])]
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .####[([1], [3]), ([9], [3]), ([12], [3]), ([15], [3])]
I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .####[([10], [7])]
And the staff is also young , energeic and hot ! ! ! !####[([2], [9])]
I work near-by , and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item .####[([9], [8])]
both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling .####[([4], [3]), ([10], [22]), ([15], [22])]
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .####[([2], [4]), ([8, 9, 10], [17]), ([14], [13])]
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .####[([19], [18])]

It 's simply the best meal in NYC .####[([5], [4])]
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .####[([0], [9])]
They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .####[([11], [6])]
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .####[([6], [5])]
Always popular , always full , always a wait .####[([8], [6])]
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio ( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .####[([29], [28])]
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .####[([23], [26])]
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .####[([1], [4]), ([9], [8])]
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .####[([0], [5, 6]), ([10], [15])]
The ambience is very calm and quiet .####[([1], [4])]
The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20])]
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .####[([0, 1], [7, 8])]
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .####[([2, 3], [0])]
Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .####[([11], [9])]
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .####[([0, 1], [4]), ([20], [19]), ([13], [12]), ([23, 24], [27]), ([30, 31], [39, 40]), ([34], [39, 40])]
But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .####[([21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], [17]), ([18], [17])]

if you 're looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here - if you 're looking for interesting combinations , try Sushi of gari 's ( east side ) .####[([7], [5]), ([21], [17])]
The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .####[([3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])]
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .####[([5], [4]), ([12], [11])]
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .####[([13], [16])]
Despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with tables .####[([5], [7]), ([15], [11])]
Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .####[([14], [19])]
Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .####[([0], [2]), ([6, 7], [2])]
Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier .####[([7], [9, 10, 11, 12])]

The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .####[([12, 13], [21])]
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .####[([2, 3], [1]), ([5], [1]), ([9], [8])]

- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .####[([2], [7, 8]), ([16], [18])]

The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .####[([1, 2], [5])]

Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .####[([1], [0]), ([5], [4]), ([19, 20], [13])]
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .####[([1], [3, 4])]
One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .####[([21], [24])]
It 's constantly open , catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St. , so there 's more turnover with the food than you 'd expect ( i.e. , surprisingly fresh ) .####[([23], [31, 32])]
Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .####[([3], [5]), ([8], [10]), ([16, 17], [15])]
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I 've tried similar dishes at .####[([7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [21])]
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) .####[([0], [3]), ([19, 20], [37]), ([32], [28])]
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .####[([1], [5]), ([9], [11]), ([24], [28]), ([16, 17, 18], [15])]
We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .####[([32], [35])]
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte .####[([5, 6], [2]), ([10, 11, 12], [2])]
Because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .####[([7, 8], [10]), ([5], [3])]

The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .####[([1], [3])]
The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .####[([5, 6], [4]), ([11], [10]), ([20], [26]), ([22], [23])]
The meat dishes were only so-so .####[([1, 2], [5])]
While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .####[([2], [4, 5, 6])]
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([16], [18])]
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza .####[([7], [3]), ([16, 17], [13])]
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .####[([1], [10]), ([3], [10]), ([5], [10])]
Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) .####[([3], [2]), ([16, 17], [5])]
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) .####[([16], [11]), ([14], [11])]

We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .####[([19], [31])]
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .####[([6], [11]), ([9], [11]), ([15], [12])]
The service is decent even when this small place is packed .####[([1], [3]), ([8], [10])]
I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .####[([4], [1]), ([18], [17])]

Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .####[([0], [2, 3])]
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .####[([1], [7]), ([19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], [13])]
Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great .####[([4], [3])]
The service is awful .####[([1], [3])]
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .####[([5, 6, 7], [4])]
Just stick with the small dishes !####[([5], [4])]
The food is great , service is ok .####[([1], [3]), ([5], [7])]
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .####[([1], [3]), ([5, 6], [8])]
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .####[([1, 2], [11]), ([4, 5], [11])]
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####[([1], [5, 6]), ([9], [11]), ([19, 20], [23])]

Indoor was very cozy and cute .####[([0], [5])]
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !####[([2, 3], [0])]
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [6]), ([11, 12], [6])]
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .####[([3, 4], [1]), ([6, 7], [1]), ([10, 11], [1]), ([15, 16, 17, 18], [1])]
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .####[([1], [3])]
The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .####[([1, 2, 3], [6]), ([10], [12]), ([15], [17])]
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .####[([1], [0]), ([5], [4]), ([8], [7])]
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .####[([1], [10]), ([14], [15, 16, 17, 18])]
What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .####[([8], [11]), ([17], [20])]
This place is a great stop for great food .####[([8], [7])]
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .####[([2], [6])]
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .####[([0], [2]), ([4], [6]), ([8, 9], [13])]
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .####[([1], [3]), ([7], [9])]
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .####[([12], [2])]
Every course was better than the next .####[([1], [3])]
Decent wine at reasonable prices .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3])]
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .####[([20], [19]), ([26], [25]), ([15, 16, 17], [12, 13])]
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .####[([4], [3])]
The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .####[([4, 5], [1])]

The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .####[([1], [11])]
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .####[([5], [4]), ([13], [12])]
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .####[([2], [5]), ([7, 8, 9], [5])]
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !####[([9], [6]), ([12], [14])]
I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or Tofu plates .####[([3, 4, 5], [1]), ([7, 8], [1]), ([10, 11], [1])]
The counter service is bad .####[([1, 2], [4])]
The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .####[([3, 4, 5], [3]), ([7, 8, 9], [7]), ([28], [27]), ([19], [18])]
While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point .####[([7], [4]), ([12], [4]), ([16], [18, 19, 20, 21]), ([2], [4])]
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !####[([31], [36])]
The waiter was attentive .####[([1], [3])]
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .####[([5], [3])]
Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .####[([3, 4, 5], [10, 11])]
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .####[([1], [4])]
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .####[([12, 13], [11])]
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .####[([1], [3]), ([14], [16, 17, 18]), ([7], [16, 17, 18]), ([10, 11], [16, 17, 18])]

The best Chicken pad tai , I 've ever had .####[([2, 3, 4], [1])]
Much more reasonably priced too !####[([3], [2])]
And really large portions .####[([3], [2])]
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) .####[([0, 1, 2, 3], [8])]
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .####[([11, 12, 13], [1]), ([15], [1])]
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .####[([1, 2], [5]), ([9], [11])]
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .####[([0], [3])]

Food was average but tasty .####[([0], [4])]

After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like .####[([4, 5], [1])]
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .####[([17], [3])]
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !####[([23], [33])]
Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .####[([4, 5], [7])]
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .####[([0], [8]), ([2], [8])]
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .####[([5], [2, 3, 4]), ([8], [12])]
The food was good .####[([1], [3])]
The food was absolutely amazing ! !####[([1], [4])]
Food is great and inexpensive .####[([0], [4])]
We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .####[([4], [3])]
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .####[([6, 7], [4]), ([9], [4])]
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .####[([1], [3])]
Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .####[([9], [8])]
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .####[([1], [7]), ([11], [15])]
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .####[([3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [11, 12])]
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .####[([20], [19]), ([33], [32]), ([4, 5], [7, 8, 9])]
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .####[([1], [6]), ([16], [15])]
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .####[([3], [10])]
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .####[([6], [5]), ([10], [9])]
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .####[([12, 13, 14], [7]), ([8, 9], [7])]
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .####[([4], [6])]
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .####[([4, 5], [8, 9, 10, 11])]
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .####[([2], [16]), ([5], [16]), ([8], [16])]
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion ( and price ) .####[([26], [25])]
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .####[([1], [4])]
I do n't like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .####[([4, 5], [1, 2, 3])]
The soup is pretty good too .####[([1], [4])]
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .####[([5], [4]), ([9], [8])]
Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) .####[([9], [15])]
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .####[([3], [2])]
Do n't waste money on decor .####[([5], [2])]
The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [9]), ([12], [14])]
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .####[([1], [12]), ([4], [3]), ([7], [9])]
The food was actually awful .####[([1], [4])]
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .####[([1], [6])]
Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !####[([0], [2])]
After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !####[([4], [12]), ([14], [12])]
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .####[([1], [6]), ([3], [6])]
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .####[([1], [4])]
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .####[([6], [15])]
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend .####[([0], [4])]
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .####[([7], [1]), ([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [19]), ([21], [19])]
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .####[([5], [2]), ([8], [2]), ([11], [2])]
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .####[([2, 3], [1]), ([6], [1]), ([10], [1])]
this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .####[([20], [19]), ([29], [19]), ([23, 24, 25, 26], [22])]
The Thai food is good .####[([1, 2], [4])]
Fish is so very fresh .####[([0], [4])]
I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .####[([8], [6])]
Again , the waitress was awesome .####[([3], [5])]
Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed .####[([11], [13, 14, 15, 16])]
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .####[([10], [6, 7, 8, 9])]
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .####[([6], [2])]
The flavors are very fresh and pretty unobtrusive , nothing flashy .####[([1], [7])]
Try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious .####[([2, 3], [10])]
It 's the perfect restaurant for NY life style , it got cool design , awesome drinks and food and lot 's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar ...####[([13], [12]), ([16], [15]), ([18], [15]), ([32], [31])]
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .####[([4], [3]), ([7], [10])]
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .####[([1], [4, 5]), ([8], [7]), ([12], [10, 11]), ([11], [10])]
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles .####[([20], [18]), ([23], [22])]
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .####[([10], [3, 4])]
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .####[([6, 7], [5]), ([11], [9])]
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray 's , Sal has risen again to carry on his father 's uncle 's legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let 's not forget the Outstanding Pizza !####[([42], [41])]
My steak au poivre was one of the worst I 've had .####[([1, 2, 3], [8])]
So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .####[([14], [12]), ([20, 21], [20])]
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .####[([3], [8, 9]), ([6], [8, 9])]
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .####[([4, 5], [14])]
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .####[([0], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), ([12, 13], [6])]
It 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .####[([5], [8]), ([11], [13])]
As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city .####[([19, 20], [16])]
You must try the shrimp appetizers .####[([4, 5], [2])]
Their Margarita is best I 've had since I 've returned from Naples !####[([1], [3])]
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .####[([1], [3])]
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .####[([4, 5], [1])]
The highly spiced chai tea was great too .####[([3, 4], [6])]
Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet .####[([1], [0]), ([11], [15])]
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .####[([1], [6])]
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people .####[([1], [3])]
The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .####[([1], [15])]
Wine list is not huge but def well selected .####[([0, 1], [7, 8])]
But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .####[([5], [10])]
Very romantic fires - I 've literally spent hours at Lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience .####[([17], [16]), ([21], [19])]
This was the worst dining experience I 've ever had .####[([4, 5], [3])]
the food was undercooked -the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .####[([1], [3]), ([10], [11]), ([5], [6])]
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it .####[([6], [2])]
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .####[([1, 2], [0]), ([4], [6, 7, 8]), ([12, 13], [16, 17]), ([8], [6])]
Not a small feat for good french food in the area .####[([6, 7], [5])]
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .####[([0], [2])]
The fries are yummy .####[([1], [3])]
Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK .####[([1], [9])]
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !####[([0, 1], [4]), ([12], [11])]
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .####[([3], [1])]
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .####[([1], [5]), ([14], [13])]
The food was very well prepared .####[([1], [4, 5])]
They charge different prices all the time .####[([3], [2])]
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City .####[([2], [4]), ([7, 8], [13])]
The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .####[([3], [6]), ([10, 11], [13, 14]), ([19, 20], [22, 23])]
I look forward to eating here again####[([4], [1, 2])]
If you 're craving for Haru 's great food , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !####[([8], [7])]
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .####[([11], [12])]
This place is not worth the prices .####[([6], [3, 4])]
Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .####[([4], [3]), ([12], [9]), ([15], [9])]
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .####[([5, 6], [12])]
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .####[([4, 5], [3]), ([9], [8])]
Decor is charming .####[([0], [2])]
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .####[([4], [2]), ([22, 23], [27])]
The location is perfect .####[([1], [3])]
But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .####[([6], [8]), ([19], [25]), ([22], [25])]
The owner truly caters to all your needs .####[([1], [3])]
Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .####[([4], [9])]
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .####[([3], [2]), ([7], [5])]
It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucous dinner .####[([17], [16])]
Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .####[([10], [7])]
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .####[([13], [16]), ([3], [9])]
Plus they made a perfect martini .####[([5], [4])]
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .####[([6], [1])]
Reasonable prices .####[([1], [0])]
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !####[([3, 4, 5], [8])]
The bagels are fabulous .####[([1], [3])]
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .####[([2, 3], [6])]
Service here was great , food was fantastic .####[([0], [3]), ([5], [7])]
It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai .####[([17], [16])]
Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .####[([12], [9])]
The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .####[([1], [3]), ([11], [13]), ([6], [8])]
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .####[([1], [5]), ([3], [5])]
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .####[([1], [5])]
Light , refreshing summer rolls ( not fried ) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris .####[([3, 4], [2])]
The service was superb , they treat you like family .####[([1], [3])]
Ummm ... the beer was cold .####[([3], [5])]
I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .####[([19], [18])]
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .####[([2, 3, 4], [18]), ([19], [18])]
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .####[([4, 5], [2]), ([11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [2])]
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .####[([8], [7]), ([11], [12, 13, 14])]
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !####[([15], [19]), ([23], [21, 22])]
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .####[([10], [8, 9])]
Great food , great decor , great service .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3]), ([7], [6])]
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .####[([1, 2], [5, 6])]
A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .####[([12], [11]), ([15], [14]), ([19], [18])]
The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .####[([2, 3], [7])]
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .####[([1], [9]), ([3], [9]), ([13, 14], [16])]
Not impressed with the food .####[([4], [0, 1])]
black white shakes came out good also .####[([0, 1, 2], [5])]
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .####[([2], [7])]
THe Pizza and wine were excellent -the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .####[([1], [5]), ([3], [5]), ([7], [5])]
Sure , the setting is nice .####[([3], [5])]
Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .####[([5, 6], [0])]
A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .####[([7, 8, 9], [16]), ([13], [16]), ([1, 2, 3, 4], [16])]
They do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .####[([12], [19]), ([20], [19])]
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !####[([2], [5]), ([22], [21]), ([24], [21])]
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .####[([13], [12]), ([15], [12]), ([18], [12])]
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , I felt there was more than enough food .####[([21], [18, 19, 20])]
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .####[([4], [6]), ([7], [6])]
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere .####[([6], [5])]
The waitresses are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .####[([1], [3])]
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor .####[([1], [4]), ([6], [8, 9]), ([20], [22])]
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .####[([5], [8]), ([11], [10])]
Prices are very good .####[([0], [3])]
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .####[([7], [15])]
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .####[([3], [6])]
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .####[([1], [0]), ([3], [0]), ([5], [0]), ([9], [8])]
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .####[([7], [6])]
i 've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good .####[([13, 14], [19])]
What an amazing meal and experience !####[([3], [2])]
While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .####[([2], [9])]
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .####[([18], [17]), ([30, 31], [40]), ([34, 35], [40])]
The bagel was huge .####[([1], [3])]
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .####[([1], [3]), ([8], [11])]
It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .####[([6], [2])]
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .####[([1], [3]), ([9], [3]), ([13], [15])]
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ .####[([3], [1, 2])]
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .####[([1], [3]), ([9, 10], [8]), ([15], [19, 20])]
The sides were ok and incredibly salty .####[([1], [6])]
We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .####[([15], [16])]
Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz ( the chilaquiles were awesome !####[([4], [6]), ([7, 8], [6]), ([20], [22]), ([12, 13], [11]), ([16, 17], [15])]

Very popular style Izakaya ( Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ) .####[([11], [10]), ([8], [7])]

The service was excellent - friendly and attentive .####[([1], [7])]
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .####[([7], [4])]
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .####[([1], [7]), ([4], [28])]
It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .####[([4], [3])]
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .####[([1, 2], [4]), ([7], [9])]
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent .####[([1], [8])]
However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation .####[([18], [15])]
So , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .####[([3], [15])]
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .####[([7, 8, 9, 10, 11], [3])]
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .####[([7], [6])]
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .####[([1], [6])]
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .####[([5, 6], [9])]
The food was exceptional .####[([1], [3])]
So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .####[([4], [7])]
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) .####[([1, 2, 3], [5]), ([17], [11, 12, 13]), ([19], [11, 12, 13])]
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent .####[([8], [10])]
Decor leaves something to be desired .####[([0], [5])]
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .####[([2, 3], [17]), ([8, 9, 10, 11], [17]), ([22], [17]), ([24, 25], [17])]
The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining .####[([1], [7])]
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT 's .####[([12], [11])]
The staff is also attentive and friendly .####[([1], [4])]
Our server was very helpful and friendly .####[([1], [6])]
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .####[([3, 4, 5], [9])]
The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .####[([1], [8])]
Kind , attentive wait staff .####[([3, 4], [2])]
The food however , is what one might expect .####[([1], [8])]
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .####[([3], [2]), ([8], [13])]
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .####[([2, 3], [1])]
Good drink .####[([1], [0])]
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .####[([1, 2, 3], [7]), ([10], [12])]
Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy .####[([0], [7]), ([2], [7])]
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .####[([3], [1])]
The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .####[([1], [3]), ([7], [9]), ([12], [14])]
Bill a little high , but worth it .####[([0], [6])]
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had .####[([1, 2], [7]), ([4], [7])]
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .####[([6, 7], [12, 13])]
I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .####[([3, 4, 5], [13]), ([10], [13])]
If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place .####[([7], [6])]
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .####[([11], [15, 16])]
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .####[([29], [13]), ([7], [5]), ([14], [13])]
The decor is very simple but comfortable .####[([1], [6])]
More important , the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo .####[([4], [7])]
Food and service was okay .####[([0], [4]), ([2], [4])]
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .####[([9], [7])]
Excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .####[([1], [0]), ([4], [3]), ([8], [7])]

Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .####[([11], [13]), ([4, 5, 6, 7], [2])]
The Dim Sum was so-so , but not spectacular .####[([1, 2], [7, 8])]
First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .####[([3], [7])]
The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch .####[([1], [3]), ([8, 9], [3]), ([14], [3]), ([19], [21])]
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d ' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .####[([0], [3]), ([16], [8]), ([13], [8])]
The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .####[([1], [3]), ([6], [8]), ([11], [13, 14, 15])]
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .####[([1], [4]), ([6, 7], [4]), ([22, 23, 24], [20, 21])]
Great vibe , lots of people .####[([1], [0])]
Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !####[([12], [10])]
