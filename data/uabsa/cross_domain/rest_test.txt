My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.####My=O party=O of=O two=O was=O feeling=O particularly=O ambitious=O ,=O and=O we=O splurged=O on=O the=O Shilshole=T-POS Sampler=T-POS beautiful=O assortment=O of=O enormous=O white=T-POS gulf=T-POS prawns=T-POS ,=O smoked=O albacore=O tuna=O ,=O Ray=O 's=O fantastic=O manila=T-POS clams=T-POS seasoned=O with=O dill=O ,=O scallops=O in=O a=O tasty=O soy=T-POS dressing=T-POS ,=O and=O a=O tiny=O pile=O of=O Dungeness=O crab=O atop=O a=O sublime=O butter=T-POS sauce=T-POS .=O
