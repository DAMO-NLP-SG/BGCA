I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).####I=O showed=O it=O to=O the=O manager=T-POS ,=O and=O he=O smilingly=O apologized=O and=O brought=O us=O two=O free=O desserts=O but=O did=O not=O ask=O us=O what=O we=O wanted=O and=O so=O brought=O the=O last=O two=O desserts=O we=O would=O have=O asked=O for=O .=O
